This study reports the results of a survey comparing educators’ (n = 68) and university students’ (n = 158) perceptions on the appropriate use of GenAI in the writing process. The survey included representations of user prompts and output from ChatGPT, a GenAI chatbot, for each of six tasks of the writing process (brainstorming, outlining, writing, revising, feedback, and evaluating). Survey respondents were asked to differentiate between various uses of GenAI for these tasks, which were divided between student and teacher use. Results indicate minor disagreement between students and teachers on acceptable use of GenAI tools in the writing process, as well as classroom and institutional-level lack of preparedness for GenAI.

Methods: We searched published case reports from our department for difficult or uncommon case descriptions and mock cases created by physicians for common case descriptions. We entered the case descriptions into the prompt of Google Bard to generate the top 10 differential-diagnosis lists. As in previous studies, other physicians created differential-diagnosis lists by reading the same clinical descriptions. Results: A total of 82 clinical descriptions (52 case reports and 30 mock cases) were used. The accuracy rates of physicians were still higher than Google Bard in the top 10 (56.1% vs 82.9%, P < .001), the top 5 (53.7% vs 78.0%, P = .002), and the top differential diagnosis (40.2% vs 64.6%, P = .003). Even within the specific context of case reports, physicians consistently outperformed Google Bard. When it came to mock cases, the performances of the differential-diagnosis lists by Google Bard were no different from those of the physicians in the top 10 (80.0% vs 96.6%, P = .11) and the top 5 (76.7% vs 96.6%, P = .06), except for those in the top diagnoses (60.0% vs 90.0%, P = .02). Conclusion: While physicians excelled overall, and particularly with case reports, Google Bard displayed comparable diagnostic performance in common cases. This suggested that Google Bard possesses room for further improvement and refinement in its diagnostic capabilities. Generative AIs, including Google Bard, are anticipated to become increasingly beneficial in augmenting diagnostic accuracy. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Clinical decision supporting system; Diagnosis; Diagnostic excellence; Generative artificial intelligence; Large language model; Natural language processing,article; artificial intelligence; diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; human; large language model; natural language processing; physician; systematic review,"T.

We generally trust our colleagues after initial clearance/background checks; and systems to function as intended and within operating parameters after safety engineering review, verification, validation, and/ or system qualification testing. This approach has led to increased insider threat impacts; thus, we suggest moving to the ""trust, but verify""approach embodied by the Zero-Trust paradigm. Zero-Trust is increasingly adopted for network security but has not seen wide adoption in systems design and operation. Achieving the goal of Zero-Trust throughout the systems lifecycle will help to ensure that no single bad actor-whether human or machine learning/artificial intelligence (ML/AI)-can induce failure anywhere in a system's lifecycle. Additionally, while ML/AI and their associated risks are already entrenched within the operations phase of many systems' lifecycles, ML/AI is gaining traction during the design phase. For example, generative design algorithms are increasingly popular, but there is less understanding of potential risks. Adopting the Zero-Trust philosophy helps ensure robust and resilient design, manufacture, operations, maintenance, upgrade, and disposal of systems. We outline the rewards and challenges of implementing Zero-Trust and propose the framework for Zero-Trust for the system design lifecycle.

While the promises of generative artificial intelligence are compelling, this technology harbors significant biases, including those related to gender. Gender biases create patterns of behavior and stereotypes that put women, men and gender-diverse people at a disadvantage. Gender inequalities and injustices affect society as a whole. As a social practice, gendering is achieved through the repeated citation of rituals, expectations and norms. Shared understandings are often captured in scripts, including those emerging in and from generative AI, which means that gendered views and gender biases get grafted back into social, political and economic life. This paper’s central argument is that large language models work performatively, which means that they perpetuate and perhaps even amplify old and non-inclusive understandings of gender. Examples from ChatGPT are used here to illustrate some gender biases in AI. However, this paper also puts forward that AI can work to mitigate biases and act to ‘undo gender’. © 2023 by the author.",ChatGPT; ethical AI; gender; gender bias; generative AI; large language models; performativity,,"N.

An important research direction of the field is to provide students with customised learning trajectories via student modelling. Previous studies have shown that customisation of learning trajectories could effectively improve students’ learning experiences and outcomes. However, training an ITS that can customise students’ learning trajectories suffers from cold-start, time-consumption, human labour-intensity, and cost problems. One feasible approach is to simulate real students’ behaviour trajectories through algorithms, to generate data that could be used to train the ITS. Nonetheless, implementing high-accuracy student modelling methods that effectively address these issues remains an ongoing challenge. Traditional simulation methods, in particular, encounter difficulties in ensuring the quality and diversity of the generated data, thereby limiting their capacity to provide intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) with high-fidelity and diverse training data. We thus propose Sim-GAIL, a novel student modelling method based on generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL). To the best of our knowledge, it is the first method using GAIL to address the challenge of lacking training data, resulting from the issues mentioned above. We analyse and compare the performance of Sim-GAIL with two traditional Reinforcement Learning-based and Imitation Learning-based methods using action distribution evaluation, cumulative reward evaluation, and offline-policy evaluation. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional ones on most metrics. Moreover, we apply our method to a domain plagued by the cold-start problem, knowledge tracing (KT), and the results show that our novel method could effectively improve the KT model’s prediction accuracy in a cold-start scenario. © 2023, The Author(s).",Generative adversarial imitation learning; Intelligent tutoring systems; Student modelling,Computer aided instruction; Education computing; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Learning systems; Online systems; Reinforcement learning; Students; Cold-start; Generative adversarial imitation learning; Imitation learning; Intelligent tutoring; Intelligent tutoring system; Learning trajectories; Model method; Student Modeling; Training data; Tutoring system; Trajectories,"L.

University education needs to maintain its relevance in an AI-mediated world, but the higher education sector is only beginning to engage deeply with the implications of AI within society. We define AI according to a relational epistemology, where, in the context of a particular interaction, a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action and that this judgement cannot be traced. Therefore, by definition, AI must always act as a ‘black box’. Rather than seeking to explain ‘black boxes’, we argue that a pedagogy for an AI-mediated world involves learning to work with opaque, partial and ambiguous situations, which reflect the entangled relationships between people and technologies. Such a pedagogy asks learners locate AI as socially bounded, where AI is always understood within the contexts of its use. We outline two particular approaches to achieve this: (a) orienting students to quality standards that surround AIs, what might be called the tacit and explicit ‘rules of the game’; and (b) providing meaningful interactions with AI systems. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Artificial intelligence (AI) is conceptualised in many different ways but is rarely defined in the higher education literature. Experts have outlined a range of graduate capabilities for working in a world of AI such as teamwork or ethical thinking. The higher education literature outlines an imperative need to respond to AI, as underlined by recent commentary on ChatGPT. What this paper adds A definition of an AI that is relational: A particular interaction where a computational artefact provides a judgement about an optimal course of action, which cannot be easily traced. Focusing on working with AI black boxes rather than trying to see inside the technology. Describing a pedagogy for an AI-mediated world that promotes working in complex situations with partial and indeterminate information. Implications for practice and/or policy Focusing on quality standards helps learners understand the social regulating boundaries around AI. Promoting learner interactions with AI as part of a sociotechnical ensemble helps build evaluative judgement in weighting AI's contribution to work. Asking learners to work with AI systems prompts understanding of the evaluative, ethical and practical necessities of working with a black box. © 2023 The Authors.

Using different models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) and platforms (ChatPDF and Bing), we obtained three full reviews, both qualitative and quantitative, for each of the five articles examined, thus being able to delineate and contrast the results of all of them in terms of the human reviews that these same articles received at the time. The evidence found highlights the extent to which we can and should rely on generative language models to support our decisions as qualified experts in our field. Further-more, the results also corroborate the hallucinations inherent in these models while pointing out one of their current major shortcomings: the context window limit. On the other hand, the study also points out the inherent benefits of a model that is in a clear expansion phase, providing a detailed view of the potential and limitations that these models offer as possible assistants to the review of scientific articles, a key process in the communication and dissemination of academic research. © 2023, El Profesional de la Informacion.

However, practical testing and evaluation in school education are still relatively unexplored. This article examines the utilization of generative AI in primary school education. The study involved 110 pupils, aged 8–14 years old, studying in the 4th–6th grades across four classes in two schools. Using laptops, pupils participated in test lessons where content, text, figures, and exercises were generated and modified using generative AI, specifically ChatGPT-3.5. The results demonstrated that it was possible to use ChatGPT-3.5, as one example of generative AI, to personify learning material so that it would meet the knowledge and learning skills of pupils with different levels of knowledge. A clear majority of pupils enjoyed learning the generative AI-modified material. There is a promising potential of generative AI use in school education, supporting pupils’ motivated learning and skills development. However, these tools need to be developed, refined and optimized to ensure proper adaptation and to create impactful, inclusive, and sustainable learning in schools to benefit pupils, teachers and education managers alike. © 2023 by the authors.",ChatGPT; cognitive ergonomics; generative AI; history; inclusion; learning; school children; school education; Spanish; sustainable development,artificial intelligence; cognition; education; knowledge; learning; sustainable development,"J.S.

Methods: We selected 11 cases with primary and secondary glaucoma from a publicly accessible online database of case reports. A total of four cases had primary glaucoma including open-angle, juvenile, normal-tension, and angle-closure glaucoma, while seven cases had secondary glaucoma including pseudo-exfoliation, pigment dispersion glaucoma, glaucomatocyclitic crisis, aphakic, neovascular, aqueous misdirection, and inflammatory glaucoma. We input the text of each case detail into ChatGPT and asked for provisional and differential diagnoses. We then presented the details of 11 cases to three senior ophthalmology residents and recorded their provisional and differential diagnoses. We finally evaluated the responses based on the correct diagnoses and evaluated agreements. Results: The provisional diagnosis based on ChatGPT was correct in eight out of 11 (72.7%) cases and three ophthalmology residents were correct in six (54.5%), eight (72.7%), and eight (72.7%) cases, respectively. The agreement between ChatGPT and the first, second, and third ophthalmology residents were 9, 7, and 7, respectively. Conclusions: The accuracy of ChatGPT in diagnosing patients with primary and secondary glaucoma, using specific case examples, was similar or better than senior ophthalmology residents. With further development, ChatGPT may have the potential to be used in clinical care settings, such as primary care offices, for triaging and in eye care clinical practices to provide objective and quick diagnoses of patients with glaucoma. © 2023, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence (AI); ChatGPT; Differential diagnosis; Glaucoma; Large language models (LLM); Provisional diagnosis,Article; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; chemexfoliation; clinical practice; diagnostic accuracy; differential diagnosis; dispersion; eye care; glaucoma; human; intraocular pressure; malignant glaucoma; neovascular glaucoma; ophthalmology; patient triage; pigmentation; primary medical care; pseudoexfoliation; refraction error; resident; secondary glaucoma,"S.

In addition to the challenge of providing personalized learning experiences for students, these technologies can increase the workload of instructors due to the maintenance and updates required to keep the courses up-to-date. Intelligent chatbots based on generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology can help overcome these disadvantages by transforming pedagogical activities and guiding both students and instructors interactively. In this study, we explore and compare the main characteristics of existing educational chatbots. Then, we propose a new theoretical framework for blended learning with intelligent chatbots integration enabling students to interact online and instructors to create and manage their courses using generative AI tools. The advantages of the proposed framework are as follows: (1) it provides a comprehensive understanding of the transformative potential of AI chatbots in education and facilitates their effective implementation; (2) it offers a holistic methodology to enhance the overall educational experience; and (3) it unifies the applications of intelligent chatbots in teaching–learning activities within universities. © 2023 by the authors.",active learning; conversational chatbots; generative artificial intelligence; machine learning; online learning; students’ engagement,E-learning; Learning systems; Machine learning; Active Learning; Chatbots; Conversational chatbot; Generative artificial intelligence; High educations; Interactivity; Learning technology; Machine-learning; Online learning; Student engagement; Students,"G.

ChatGPT is a type of chatbot, developed by OpenAI, that uses the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) language model to understand and respond to natural language inputs. AI chatbot and ChatGPT in particular appear to be useful tools in scientific writing, assisting researchers and scientists in organizing material, generating an initial draft and/or in proofreading. There is no publication in the field of critical care medicine prepared using this approach; however, this will be a possibility in the next future. ChatGPT work should not be used as a replacement for human judgment and the output should always be reviewed by experts before being used in any critical decision-making or application. Moreover, several ethical issues arise about using these tools, such as the risk of plagiarism and inaccuracies, as well as a potential imbalance in its accessibility between high- and low-income countries, if the software becomes paying. For this reason, a consensus on how to regulate the use of chatbots in scientific writing will soon be required. © 2023, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Chatbots; Machine learning; Scientific writing,Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Writing; Article; artificial intelligence; consensus; data accuracy; data quality; decision making; high income country; information processing; information source; intensive care medicine; low income country; machine learning; plagiarism; publication; research ethics; scientific literature; scientist; human; writing,"M.

This has increased concerns from both scholars and practitioners regarding the potential impacts of ChatGPT on students' learning. However, research on higher education students' adoption of ChatGPT is still scant. Drawing on the modified technology acceptance model (TAM) and a sample of 1389 higher education students recruited in 11 universities in Vietnam with a stratified random sampling approach, the findings of this study indicated that effort expectancy not only directly affected students' actual usage of ChatGPT, but also serially indirectly increased their actual use of ChatGPT through performance expectancy and intentions to use ChatGPT. Additionally, knowledge sharing was found to significantly increase higher education students’ transformation from having the intention to use ChatGPT to actual users of ChatGPT. The theoretical and managerial implications of this are discussed in this paper in order to gain benefits and manage the potential threats from this new technology. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Actual use of ChatGPT; Behavior intention to use ChatGPT; Knowledge sharing; Technology acceptance model,,"C.D.

Retrogression to physical contact is counterproductive. The hasty implementation of remote learning during the pandemic deprived IHEs of opportunities to efficiently enact and theorise about it. Post-pandemic, IHEs have opportunities to theorise about remote learning hence the questions; a) what type of learning emerges when asynchronous and technology-as-essence framework undergirds students learning? b) What benefits accrue when chat-Generative Pre-training Transformer (chat-GPT) is infused into students learning? Use of synchronous learning and technology-as-utility framework to underpin remote learning during the pandemic was intended to retain most of physical contact learning traditions. Teachers and students met synchronously and simultaneously online for learning to occur. IHEs safeguarded their operational efficiency to minimise the disruptive nature of remote learning. The purpose of the study was to theoretically examine effects of asynchronous learning and “technology-as-essence framework on students learning. Asynchronous learning occurs when students registered on the same course learn online on their own schedule without any real-time interactions with teachers. This phenomenon occurs when remote learning develops through technological advances that, beyond 2030, would most likely stream educational courses similar to Netflix. One such technological advance is chat-GPT. A study was undertaken to better understand it. 15 multi-disciplinary advanced undergraduates tested out chat-GPT on their assignments and a concrete problem. Chat-GPT lessened the time of doing assignments and improves students’ problem solving abilities. AI systems advances have a positive effect on students learning. The study addresses the positive impact of asynchronous learning and advances in technology on IHEs. © 2023, The International Academic Forum (IAFOR).

The recent release of the large language model Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) has attracted significant attention from the public and various industries. This study applied ChatGPT to autonomous building system operations, specifically coupling it with an EnergyPlus reference office building simulation model. The operational objective was to minimize the energy use of the building systems, including four air-handling units, two chillers, a cooling tower, and two pumps, while ensuring that indoor CO2 concentrations remain below 1000 ppm. The performance of ChatGPT in an autonomous operation was compared with control results based on a deep Q-network (DQN), which is a reinforcement learning method. The ChatGPT and DQN lowered the total energy use by 16.8% and 24.1%, respectively, compared with the baseline operation, while maintaining an indoor CO2 concentration below 1000 ppm. Notably, compared with the DQN, ChatGPT-based control does not require a learning process to develop intelligence for building control. In real-world applications, the high generalization capabilities of the ChatGPT-based control, resulting from its extensive training on vast and diverse data, could potentially make it more effective. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; autonomous building; ChatGPT; deep Q-network; large language model; reinforcement learning,Air conditioning; Carbon dioxide; Computational linguistics; Cooling systems; Energy utilization; Intelligent buildings; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Autonomous building; Building systems; Chat generative pre-trained transformer; CO 2 concentration; Deep Q-network; Energy use; Language model; Large language model; Reinforcement learnings; Systems operation; Office buildings,"K.U.

However, a research gap exists in understanding the effects of using such web-based platforms on narrative intelligence and writing self-efficacy. This study aims to investigate whether digital story creation tasks on web-based platforms can influence the narrative intelligence and writing self-efficacy of undergraduate students. A pretest–posttest comparison study between two groups was conducted with sixty-four undergraduate students (n = 64), majoring in Primary Education. More specifically, it compares the effects of the most well-known conventional platforms, such as Storybird, Storyjumper, and ZooBurst (control condition), and generative AI platforms, such as Sudowrite, Jasper, and Shortly AI (experimental condition) on undergraduate students, with an equal distribution in each group. The findings indicate that the utilization of generative AI platforms in the context of story creation tasks can substantially enhance both narrative intelligence scores and writing self-efficacy when compared to conventional platforms. Nonetheless, there was no significant difference in the creative identity factor.

However, one of the main challenges is to find a suitable representation of the scenarios both for evaluation and decision-making. The development of future scenarios requires high creativity and simple textual descriptions could not be enough to grab the attention of the experts and decision-makers, due to a probable lack of communication and/or technical language. Since the textual descriptions concern the future, the human mind may have difficulty imagining events that have not already happened. With the spread of AI models, different implementations can support the DBS process, such as the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate specific images starting from the narratives of the scenarios. In this paper, we propose a new method for the development of Delphi-based Visual Scenarios (DBVS) adopting GANs, with the aim to support the experts and decision-makers in planning and communication, in order to have immediate images of what the future could be like.

While most of these debates are about higher education in general, this article focuses on schoolteacher education and teacher training. This research aimed to determine the contribution of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT in lesson planning, critical thinking and openness in education. The research used a qualitative approach and document analysis following an interpretative paradigm. The findings reveal that generative language models such as ChatGPT can provide specific materials and support mechanisms, such as lesson plans, to schoolteachers and student teachers. It also showed that ChatGPT has levelled the playing field by opening access to lesson plans to all teachers. However, to unleash their full potential for education, it is crucial to approach these models with caution and critically evaluate their limitations and potential biases, understanding that they are tools to support teaching and learning and do not replace teachers. The study’s contribution lies in ChatGPT-generated lesson plans’ implications and the enhancement of critical thinking for teacher education, and it also underscores the need for further research to explore best practices for integrating ChatGPT in lesson planning. © 2023 by the authors.",artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; critical thinking; lesson plans; open education; teacher education,,"E. du Plessis; Department of Curriculum and Instructional Studies, University of South Africa, Pretoria, 0003, South Africa; email: dplesec@unisa.ac.za",,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI),22277102,,,,English,Educ.

To effectively navigate this shift, it is crucial to embrace AI as a contemporary educational trend and establish pedagogical principles for properly utilizing emerging technologies like ChatGPT to promote self-regulation. Rather than suppressing AI-driven tools, educators should foster collaborations among stakeholders, including educators, instructional designers, AI researchers, and developers. This paper proposes three key pedagogical principles for integrating AI chatbots in classrooms, informed by Zimmerman’s Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) framework and Judgment of Learning (JOL). We argue that the current conceptualization of AI chatbots in education is inadequate, so we advocate for the incorporation of goal setting (prompting), self-assessment and feedback, and personalization as three essential educational principles. First, we propose that teaching prompting is important for developing students’ SRL. Second, configuring reverse prompting in the AI chatbot’s capability will help to guide students’ SRL and monitoring for understanding. Third, developing a data-driven mechanism that enables an AI chatbot to provide learning analytics helps learners to reflect on learning and develop SRL strategies. By bringing in Zimmerman’s SRL framework with JOL, we aim to provide educators with guidelines for implementing AI in teaching and learning contexts, with a focus on promoting students’ self-regulation in higher education through AI-assisted pedagogy and instructional design. © 2023 by the authors.",AI pedagogy; chatbot; judgement of learning; self-regulated learning,artificial intelligence; education policy; educational development; higher education; learning; self assessment; teaching,"D.H.

It has the potential to radically transform the business landscape, with consequences for operations and supply chain management (O&SCM). However, empirical evidence on Gen-AI's effects in O&SCM remains limited. This study investigates the benefits, challenges, and trends associated with Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. We collected data from O&SCM practitioners in the UK (N = 154) and the USA (N = 161). As we used the organizational learning theory for the research, our findings reveal increased efficiency as a significant benefit for both adopters and non-adopters in both countries, while indicating security, risks, and ethical as prominent concerns. In particular, it appeared that the integration of Gen-AI/ChatGPT leads to the enhancement of the overall supply chain performance. Moreover, organizational learning can speed up the results of Gen-AI/ChatGPT in O&SCM. No wonders that adopters express their satisfaction about the post-implementation benefits of the technology, which include reduced perceived challenges for pre-implementation, and greater optimism about future Gen-AI/ChatGPT utilization compared to non-adopters. Adopters also display diverse behavioral patterns toward efficiency, agility, responsiveness, etc. This study provides valuable insights for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers interested in comprehending Gen-AI/ChatGPT's implications in O&SCM for both adopters and non-adopters. Additionally, it underscores the importance of organizational learning processes in facilitating successful Gen-AI/ChatGPT adoption in O&SCM. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",ChatGPT; Disruptive technology; Emerging technologies; Generative artificial intelligence; Operations and supply chain management; Organizational learning,Efficiency; Engineering education; Knowledge management; Supply chain management; ChatGPT; Disruptive technology; Emerging technologies; Generative artificial intelligence; Learning Theory; Operations and supply chain managements; Organizational learning; Security risks; Speed up; Supply chain performance; Artificial intelligence,"M.M.

This paper introduces “1001 Nights”, a narrative game centered on GenAI. Drawing inspiration from Wittgenstein’s note, “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world”, the game exemplifies the concept of language as reality. The protagonist, Shahrzad, possesses a unique power: specific keywords, such as “sword” or “shield”, when spoken by others in tales, materialize as tangible weapons, serving as battle equipment against the King. Players guide the LLM-driven King in co-creating narratives, with GPT-4 employing LLM reasoning methods to ensure story consistency. As these narratives progress, the depicted world is dynamically generated and visualized through Stable Diffusion, blurring the boundaries between narrative and in-game reality. This fusion of interactive storytelling combines gameplay paradigms and story together with dynamic content generation. Players not only aim to alter Shahrzad’s fate from the original folklore, but also leverage the power of natural language to shape the game’s world. With this example, we propose the term “AI-Native games” to categorize innovative games where GenAI is fundamental to the game’s novel mechanics and very existence.

One inherent challenge in this process is the interobserver variability, which can compromise the consistency and accuracy of a study. Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated its ability to automate similar examinations in clinical applications with enhanced efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. However, training AI models typically relies on costly pixel-level annotation of injured regions and is often not available for animal pathology. To address this, we developed the PathologAI system, a “weakly” supervised approach for WSI classification in rat images without explicit lesion annotation at the pixel level. Using rat liver imaging data from the Open TG-GATEs system, PathologAI was applied to predict necrosis of n = 816 WSIs (377 controls). TG-GATEs studied 170 compounds at three dose levels (low, middle, and high) for four time points (3, 7, 14, and 28 days). PathologAI first preprocessed WSIs at the tile level to generate a high-level representation with a Generative Adversarial Network architecture. The prediction of liver necrosis relied on an ensemble model of 5 CNN classifiers trained on 335 WSIs. The ensemble model achieved notable classification accuracy on the holdout test set: 87% among 87 control slides free of findings, 83% among 120 controls with spontaneous necrosis, 67% among 147 treated animals with spontaneous minimal or slight necrosis, and 59% among 127 treated animals with minimal or slight necrosis caused by the treatment. Importantly, PathologAI was able to discriminate WSIs with spontaneous necrosis from those with treatment related necrosis and discriminated mild lesion level findings (slight vs minimal) and between treatment dose levels. PathologAI could provide an inexpensive and rapid screening tool to assist the digital pathology analysis in preclinical applications and general toxicological studies. © 2023 The Authors.

According to many, GPT-4 is seen as a more reliable and creative version of GPT-3.5. Objective: In conjugation with our prior manuscript, we wanted to determine if GPT-4 could be exploited as an instrument for plastic surgery graduate medical education by evaluating its performance on the Plastic Surgery Inservice Training Examination (PSITE). Methods: Sample assessment questions from the 2022 PSITE were obtained from the American Council of Academic Plastic Surgeons website and manually inputted into GPT-4. Responses by GPT-4 were qualified using the properties of natural coherence. Incorrect answers were stratified into the consequent categories: informational, logical, or explicit fallacy. Results: From a total of 242 questions, GPT-4 provided correct answers for 187, resulting in a 77.3% accuracy rate. Logical reasoning was utilized in 95.0% of questions, internal information in 98.3%, and external information in 97.5%. Upon separating the questions based on incorrect and correct responses, a statistically significant difference was identified in GPT-4's application of logical reasoning. Conclusion: GPT-4 has shown to be more accurate and reliable for plastic surgery resident education when compared to GPT-3.5. Users should look to utilize the tool to enhance their educational curriculum. Those who adopt the use of such models may be better equipped to deliver high-quality care to their patients. © 2023 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons",AI; Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Resident education,"Curriculum; Education, Medical, Graduate; Humans; Inservice Training; Plastic Surgery Procedures; Surgery, Plastic; adult; article; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; controlled study; curriculum; education; health care quality; human; in service training; logical reasoning; medical education; plastic surgeon; plastic surgery; resident; in service training","R.

The GPT 3.5–powered ChatGPT chatbot released in late November 2022 has emerged as an immediate threat to academic and scientific writing. Methods: Both examinations and written assignments for nuclear medicine courses were tested using ChatGPT. Included was a mix of core theory subjects offered in the second and third years of the nuclear medicine science course. Long-answer–style questions (8 subjects) and calculation-style questions (2 subjects) were included for examinations. ChatGPT was also used to produce responses to authentic writing tasks (6 subjects). ChatGPT responses were evaluated by Turnitin plagiarism-detection software for similarity and artificial intelligence scores, scored against standardized rubrics, and compared with the mean performance of student cohorts. Results: ChatGPT powered by GPT 3.5 performed poorly in the 2 calculation examinations (overall, 31.7% compared with 67.3% for students), with particularly poor performance in complex-style questions. ChatGPT failed each of 6 written tasks (overall, 38.9% compared with 67.2% for students), with worsening performance corresponding to increasing writing and research expectations in the third year. In the 8 examinations, ChatGPT performed better than students for general or early subjects but poorly for advanced and specific subjects (overall, 51% compared with 57.4% for students). Conclusion: Although ChatGPT poses a risk to academic integrity, its usefulness as a cheating tool can be constrained by higher-order taxonomies. Unfortunately, the constraints to higher-order learning and skill development also undermine potential applications of ChatGPT for enhancing learning. There are several potential applications of ChatGPT for teaching nuclear medicine students.

The traditional keyword-based geosearch approach is insufficient due to the uncertainty inherent within spatial information and how it is presented in the data-sharing platform. For instance, the Gulf of Mexico Coastal Ocean Observing System (GCOOS) data search platform stores geoinformation and metadata in a complex tabular. Users can search for data by entering keywords or selecting data from a drop-down manual from the user interface. However, the search results provide limited information about the data product, where detailed descriptions, potential use, and relationship with other data products are still missing. Language models (LMs) have demonstrated great potential in tasks like question answering, sentiment analysis, text classification, and machine translation. However, they struggle when dealing with metadata represented in tabular format. To overcome these challenges, we developed Meta Question Answering System (MetaQA), a novel spatial data search model. MetaQA integrates end-to-end AI models with a generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) to enhance geosearch services. Using GCOOS metadata as a case study, we tested the effectiveness of MetaQA. The results revealed that MetaQA outperforms state-of-the-art question-answering models in handling tabular metadata, underlining its potential for user-inspired geosearch services.

As educational use cases and academic studies become increasingly prevalent, it is critical for education stakeholders to discuss design considerations and ideals that are key in supporting and augmenting learning via quality classroom discourse that sets the climate for student learning and thinking, and teachers’ transmission of expectations. In this paper, we seek to address how emergent technological advancements such as GPT, can be considered and utilized in designs that are consistent with the ideals of sustainable student discourse and knowledge creation. We showcase contemporary exemplars of possible designs and practices that are based on the pedagogy of knowledge building, with recent illustrations of how GPT may be utilized to sustain students’ knowledge building discourse. We also examine the potential effects and repercussions of technological utilization and misuse, along with insights into GPT’s role in supporting and enhancing knowledge building practices.

Neurosurgery can benefit from artificial intelligence in surgical planning, predicting patient outcomes, and analyzing neuroimaging data. GPT-4, an updated language model with additional training parameters, has exhibited exceptional performance on standardized exams. This study examines GPT-4’s competence on neurosurgical board-style questions, comparing its performance with medical students and residents, to explore its potential in medical education and clinical decision-making. Methods: GPT-4’s performance was examined on 643 Congress of Neurological Surgeons Self-Assessment Neurosurgery Exam (SANS) board-style questions from various neurosurgery subspecialties. Of these, 477 were text-based and 166 contained images. GPT-4 refused to answer 52 questions that contained no text. The remaining 591 questions were inputted into GPT-4, and its performance was evaluated based on first-time responses. Raw scores were analyzed across subspecialties and question types, and then compared to previous findings on Chat Generative pre-trained transformer performance against SANS users, medical students, and neurosurgery residents. Results: GPT-4 attempted 91.9% of Congress of Neurological Surgeons SANS questions and achieved 76.6% accuracy. The model's accuracy increased to 79.0% for text-only questions. GPT-4 outperformed Chat Generative pre-trained transformer (P < 0.001) and scored highest in pain/peripheral nerve (84%) and lowest in spine (73%) categories. It exceeded the performance of medical students (26.3%), neurosurgery residents (61.5%), and the national average of SANS users (69.3%) across all categories. Conclusions: GPT-4 significantly outperformed medical students, neurosurgery residents, and the national average of SANS users. The mode's accuracy suggests potential applications in educational settings and clinical decision-making, enhancing provider efficiency, and improving patient care. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; GPT-4; Machine learning; Neurosurgical boards; Neurosurgical training; SANS question bank,Article; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; clinical decision making; gpt 4; human; machine learning; medical education; medical student; neurosurgeon; neurosurgery; patient care; self evaluation,"G.A.

Specifically, generative writing systems have shown potential in various applications, but their effectiveness in clinical settings has been barely investigated. In this context, we evaluated the proficiency of ChatGPT-4 in diagnosing gonarthrosis and coxarthrosis and recommending appropriate treatments compared with orthopaedic specialists. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted using anonymized medical records of 100 patients previously diagnosed with either knee or hip arthrosis. ChatGPT-4 was employed to analyse these historical records, formulating both a diagnosis and potential treatment suggestions. Subsequently, a comparative analysis was conducted to assess the concordance between the AI’s conclusions and the original clinical decisions made by the physicians. Results: In diagnostic evaluations, ChatGPT-4 consistently aligned with the conclusions previously drawn by physicians. In terms of treatment recommendations, there was an 83% agreement between the AI and orthopaedic specialists. The therapeutic concordance was verified by the calculation of a Cohen’s Kappa coefficient of 0.580 (p < 0.001). This indicates a moderate-to-good level of agreement. In recommendations pertaining to surgical treatment, the AI demonstrated a sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 80%, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression demonstrated that the variables reduced quality of life (OR 49.97, p < 0.001) and start-up pain (OR 12.54, p = 0.028) have an influence on ChatGPT-4’s recommendation for a surgery. Conclusion: This study emphasises ChatGPT-4’s notable potential in diagnosing conditions such as gonarthrosis and coxarthrosis and in aligning its treatment recommendations with those of orthopaedic specialists. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that AI tools such as ChatGPT-4 are not meant to replace the nuanced expertise and clinical judgment of seasoned orthopaedic surgeons, particularly in complex decision-making scenarios regarding treatment indications. Due to the exploratory nature of the study, further research with larger patient populations and more complex diagnoses is necessary to validate the findings and explore the broader potential of AI in healthcare.

Previous deep learning AI has been structured around domain-specific areas that are trained on dataset-specific areas of interest that yield high accuracy and precision. A new AI model using large language models (LLM) and nonspecific domain areas, ChatGPT (OpenAI), has gained attention. Although AI has demonstrated proficiency in managing vast amounts of data, implementation of that knowledge remains a challenge.Questions/purposes(1) What percentage of Orthopaedic In-Training Examination questions can a generative, pretrained transformer chatbot (ChatGPT) answer correctly? (2) How does that percentage compare with results achieved by orthopaedic residents of different levels, and if scoring lower than the 10th percentile relative to 5th-year residents is likely to correspond to a failing American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery score, is this LLM likely to pass the orthopaedic surgery written boards? (3) Does increasing question taxonomy affect the LLM's ability to select the correct answer choices?MethodsThis study randomly selected 400 of 3840 publicly available questions based on the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination and compared the mean score with that of residents who took the test over a 5-year period. Questions with figures, diagrams, or charts were excluded, including five questions the LLM could not provide an answer for, resulting in 207 questions administered with raw score recorded. The LLM's answer results were compared with the Orthopaedic In-Training Examination ranking of orthopaedic surgery residents. Based on the findings of an earlier study, a pass-fail cutoff was set at the 10th percentile. Questions answered were then categorized based on the Buckwalter taxonomy of recall, which deals with increasingly complex levels of interpretation and application of knowledge; comparison was made of the LLM's performance across taxonomic levels and was analyzed using a chi-square test.ResultsChatGPT selected the correct answer 47% (97 of 207) of the time, and 53% (110 of 207) of the time it answered incorrectly. Based on prior Orthopaedic In-Training Examination testing, the LLM scored in the 40th percentile for postgraduate year (PGY) 1s, the eighth percentile for PGY2s, and the first percentile for PGY3s, PGY4s, and PGY5s; based on the latter finding (and using a predefined cutoff of the 10th percentile of PGY5s as the threshold for a passing score), it seems unlikely that the LLM would pass the written board examination. The LLM's performance decreased as question taxonomy level increased (it answered 54% [54 of 101] of Tax 1 questions correctly, 51% [18 of 35] of Tax 2 questions correctly, and 34% [24 of 71] of Tax 3 questions correctly; p = 0.034).ConclusionAlthough this general-domain LLM has a low likelihood of passing the orthopaedic surgery board examination, testing performance and knowledge are comparable to that of a first-year orthopaedic surgery resident. The LLM's ability to provide accurate answers declines with increasing question taxonomy and complexity, indicating a deficiency in implementing knowledge.Clinical RelevanceCurrent AI appears to perform better at knowledge and interpretation-based inquires, and based on this study and other areas of opportunity, it may become an additional tool for orthopaedic learning and education. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Both are national, government-set / approved, and centrally assessed examinations. We also evaluate performance differences in exams made publicly available before and after the ChatGPT knowledge cutoff date, and investigate what types of question ChatGPT struggles with. We find that ChatGPT is capable of achieving very high marks on both exams and that the performance difference before and after the knowledge cutoff date are minimal. We also observe that ChatGPT struggles with questions involving symbols or images, which can be mitigated when in-Text information gfills in the gaps'. Additionally, GPT-4 performance can be negatively impacted when an initial inaccurate answer leads to further inaccuracies in subsequent parts of the same question. Finally, the element of choice on the Leaving Certificate is a significant advantage in achieving a high grade. Notably, there are minimal occurrences of hallucinations in answers and few errors in solutions not involving images. These results reveal several strengths and weaknesses of these exams in terms of how generative AI performs on them and have implications for exam design, the construction of marking schemes, and could also shift the focus of what is examined and how. © 2023 Owner/Author.",A-Level; Artificial Intelligence; ChatGPT; examinations; Generative AI; GPT-4; high school; Ireland; K-12; LCCS; Leaving Certificate; school; second-level; UK,A-level; ChatGPT; Examination; Generative AI; GPT-4; Higher School; Ireland; K-12; LCCS; Leaving certificate; School; Second level; UK; Education computing,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,978-145038568-8,,,English,ACM Int.

Given the critical role that writing plays in learning and assessment within educational institutions, it is of growing importance for educators to make thoughtful and informed decisions as to how and in what capacity generative AI tools should be leveraged to assist in the development of students’ writing skills. This paper reports on two longitudinal studies. Study 1 examined learning outcomes of 48 university English as a new language (ENL) learners in a six-week long repeated measures quasi experimental design where the experimental group received writing feedback generated from ChatGPT (GPT-4) and the control group received feedback from their human tutor. Study 2 analyzed the perceptions of a different group of 43 ENLs who received feedback from both ChatGPT and their tutor. Results of study 1 showed no difference in learning outcomes between the two groups. Study 2 results revealed a near even split in preference for AI-generated or human-generated feedback, with clear advantages to both forms of feedback apparent from the data. The main implication of these studies is that the use of AI-generated feedback can likely be incorporated into ENL essay evaluation without affecting learning outcomes, although we recommend a blended approach that utilizes the strengths of both forms of feedback. The main contribution of this paper is in addressing generative AI as an automatic essay evaluator while incorporating learner perspectives. © 2023, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Automated writing evaluation; ChatGPT; Language education,,"J.

The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality. © 2023, The Author(s).",,Biomedical engineering; Computational linguistics; Health care; Artificial intelligence in medicine; Chatbots; Clinical documentation; Critical challenges; Diverse applications; Ethical standards; Language model; Medical technologies; Regulatory oversight; Research papers; adult; article; artificial intelligence; drug safety; human; language; privacy; reliability; vision; Clinical research,"B.

In healthcare, the utilization of digital twin and data-driven models has proven to enhance clinical decision support, particularly in the treatment and assessment of chronic wounds, leading to improved clinical outcomes. This article proposes the implementation of a digital twin in the domain of healthcare, specifically in the management of chronic wounds, by leveraging artificial intelligence techniques. The digital twin is composed of data collection, data processing, and AI models dedicated to wound healing. A novel AI pipeline is utilized to track the healing of chronic wounds. The digital twin, serving as a virtual representation of the actual wound, simulates and replicates the healing process. Furthermore, the proposed wound-healing prediction model effectively guides the treatment of chronic wounds. Additionally, by comparing the actual wound with its digital twin, the system enables early identification of non-healing wounds, facilitating timely adjustments and modifications to the treatment plan. By incorporating a digital twin in healthcare, the proposed system enables personalized and tailored treatments, potentially playing a crucial role in proactive problem identification.  © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; Chronic wound management; digital twin in healthcare; generative adversarial network (GAN); personalized medicine,Artificial Intelligence; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Wound Healing; Biological systems; Data acquisition; Data handling; Decision support systems; Generative adversarial networks; Health care; Biological system modeling; Chronic wound management; Chronic wounds; Digital twin in healthcare; Generative adversarial network; Medical services; Personalized medicines; Predictive models; Wound; Wound management; Article; artificial intelligence; caregiver; chronic wound; decision making; decision support system; digital twin; entropy; health care; hospitalization; human; learning algorithm; machine learning; personalized medicine; total quality management; training; wound assessment; wound healing; artificial intelligence; health care delivery; wound healing; Pipelines,"S.

Specifically, the most recent iteration of OpenAI’s large language model chat generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) has the potential to propel innovation and bolster operational performance in the telecommunications sector. Nowadays, the exploration of network resource management, control, and operation is still in the initial stage. In this paper, we propose a novel network artificial intelligence architecture named language model for network traffic (NetLM), a large language model based on a transformer designed to understand sequence structures in the network packet data and capture their underlying dynamics. The continual convergence of knowledge space and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies constitutes the core of intelligent network management and control. Multi-modal representation learning is used to unify the multi-modal information of network indicator data, traffic data, and text data into the same feature space. Furthermore, a NetLM-based control policy generation framework is proposed to refine intent incrementally through different abstraction levels. Finally, some potential cases are provided that NetLM can benefit the telecom industry. © 2023, Posts and Telecom Press Co Ltd.

This paper presents a study that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to examine students’ preferences for university teaching practices. We asked students in various fields open-ended questions about the best teaching practices they had experienced. Due to the large amount of data obtained, we used the AI-based language model Generative Pretrained Transformer-3 (GPT-3) to analyse the responses. With this model, we sorted students’ testimonies into nine theory-based categories regarding teaching practices. After analysing the reliability of the classifications conducted by GPT-3, we found that the agreement between humans was similar to that observed between humans and the AI model, which supported its reliability. Regarding students’ preferences for teaching practices, the results showed that students prefer practices that focus on (1) clarity and (2) interaction and relationships. These results enable the use of AI-based tools that facilitate the analysis of large amounts of information collected through open methods. At the didactic level, students’ preferences and demand for clear teaching practices (in which ideas and activities are stated and shown without ambiguity) that are based on interaction and relationships (between teachers and students and among students themselves) are demonstrable. © 2023, The Author(s).",Artificial intelligence; Higher education; Satisfaction; Teaching practices; Teaching quality,,"S.

One of the main advantages of corpora is that we know exactly the domain of texts from which the corpus data is derived, something that we cannot track from current large language models underlying applications like ChatGPT. We know the texts that make up large general corpora such as BNC2014 and BAWE, and can even extract full texts from these corpora if needed. Corpora also allow for more nuanced analysis of language patterns, including the statistics behind multi-word units and collocations, which can be difficult for GenAI to handle. However, it is important to note that GenAI has its own strengths in advancing our understanding of language-in-use that corpora, to date, have struggled with. We therefore argue that by combining corpus and GenAI approaches, language learners can gain a more comprehensive understanding of how language works in different contexts than is currently possible using only a single approach. © 2023",ChatGPT; Corpora; Data-driven learning; DDL; generative AI,,"P.

Design: The “Feb 13” version of ChatGPT by OpenAI was tested against established sources relating to patient-oriented clinical information: 17 “frequently asked questions (FAQs)” about infertility on the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Website, 2 validated fertility knowledge surveys, the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and the Fertility and Infertility Treatment Knowledge Score, as well as the American Society for Reproductive Medicine committee opinion “optimizing natural fertility.” Setting: Academic medical center. Patient(s): Online AI Chatbot. Intervention(s): Frequently asked questions, survey questions and rephrased summary statements were entered as prompts in the chatbot over a 1-week period in February 2023. Main Outcome Measure(s): For FAQs from CDC: words/response, sentiment analysis polarity and objectivity, total factual statements, rate of statements that were incorrect, referenced a source, or noted the value of consulting providers. For fertility knowledge surveys: Percentile according to published population data. For Committee Opinion: Whether response to conclusions rephrased as questions identified missing facts. Result(s): When administered the CDC's 17 infertility FAQ's, ChatGPT produced responses of similar length (207.8 ChatGPT vs. 181.0 CDC words/response), factual content (8.65 factual statements/response vs. 10.41), sentiment polarity (mean 0.11 vs. 0.11 on a scale of -1 (negative) to 1 (positive)), and subjectivity (mean 0.42 vs. 0.35 on a scale of 0 (objective) to 1 (subjective)). In total, 9 (6.12%) of 147 ChatGPT factual statements were categorized as incorrect, and only 1 (0.68%) statement cited a reference. ChatGPT would have been at the 87th percentile of Bunting's 2013 international cohort for the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and at the 95th percentile on the basis of Kudesia's 2017 cohort for the Fertility and Infertility Treatment Knowledge Score. ChatGPT reproduced the missing facts for all 7 summary statements from “optimizing natural fertility.” Conclusion(s): A February 2023 version of “ChatGPT” demonstrates the ability of generative artificial intelligence to produce relevant, meaningful responses to fertility-related clinical queries comparable to established sources. Although performance may improve with medical domain-specific training, limitations such as the inability to reliably cite sources and the unpredictable possibility of fabricated information may limit its clinical use. © 2023 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; counseling; fertility knowledge; natural language processing; online,Artificial Intelligence; Counseling; Fertility; Humans; Infertility; Language; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical article; controlled study; counseling; disease control; female; fertility; gamete intrafallopian transfer; human; infertility therapy; language ability; machine learning; male; medical informatics; multiple choice test; natural language processing; outcome assessment; reproduction; sentiment analysis; university hospital; counseling; fertility; infertility; language,"J.

Firstly, the authors adopt a scoping review of extant research to identify common emerging themes in the ChatGPT model. Secondly, the manuscript explores the emerging innovation and knowledge management challenges by problematizing gaps that need to be explored. This study setting comprises a comprehensive scoping review and analysis of the ChatGPT and related literature. Based on a substantive content analysis of 652 articles between the years 2018 and 2023, four themes emerged from the literature that present gaps to be explored in future research. The technology acceptance model (TAM) grounds the theoretical framework to explore the emerging themes and potential user satisfaction criteria. In addition, this is the first study to broaden the TAM innovation literature by applying knowledge generation criteria to assess the extent to which ChatGPT would satisfy expected user sensemaking represented by know-that, know-how, know-why, and care-why knowledge. Two research questions assessed the findings against TAM and knowledge generation criteria. Based on the emerging gaps identified, the review found that by applying TAM, user satisfaction is not expected to be high especially when applied in educational settings given specific learner needs in complex learning situations. While aspects of user knowledge is expected to increase exponentially, the quality of the information generated by ChatGPT is not expected to result in high user know-why knowledge and complex system understanding. At a time when generative AI models are challenging traditional scientific means of delivering education pedagogy in driving student and user learning, this study has important implications for the future of the ChatGPT model application within educational and broader settings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; Challenges; ChatGPT; Education sector; Strategies,Education computing; Learning systems; Technology transfer; Challenge; ChatGPT; Content analysis; Education sectors; Knowledge generations; Management challenges; Scoping review; Strategy; Technology acceptance model; Users' satisfactions; artificial intelligence; education; future prospect; innovation; knowledge based system; literature review; student; Knowledge management,"O.

In this paper, we use a disruptive–disrupting framework to discuss the dual nature of generative AI and LLMs and offer recommendations for social work researchers and journal editors that include guidance around data collection, analysis, interpretation, and dissemination. Researchers must use great caution when deploying generative AI technologies, meticulously examining, verifying, and taking accountability for the text and analyses produced by these instruments. Likewise, journal editors will need to implement quality control procedures and ethical standards to guide and evaluate the use of these technologies in social work research.

The emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, such as chatbots ChatGPT and Bard, raises concerns regarding the value of open-ended writing tasks in the classroom; one concern involves academic integrity and whether students will use these chatbots to produce sufficient responses to open-ended writing tasks. The present study investigates the degree to which generative AI chatbots exhibit mechanistic reasoning in response to organic chemistry WTL assignments. We produced responses from three generative AI chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and Bard) to two WTL assignments developed to elicit students’ mechanistic reasoning. Using previously reported machine learning models for analyzing student writing in response to the WTL assignments, we analyzed the chatbot responses for the inclusion of features pertinent to mechanistic reasoning. Herein, we report quantitative analyses of (1) the differences between chatbot responses on the two assignments and (2) the differences between chatbot and authentic student responses. Findings indicate that chatbots respond differently to different WTL assignments. Additionally, the chatbots rarely incorporated the discussion of electron movement, a key feature of mechanistic reasoning. Furthermore, the chatbots, in general, do not engage in mechanistic reasoning at the same level as students. We contextualize the results by considering academic integrity with the assumption that students’ intentions are to engage in academically honest behavior, and we focus on understanding the ethical uses of generative AI for classroom assignments. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.",Assessment; Chemical Education Research; Internet/Web-Based Learning; Mechanisms of Reactions; Organic Chemistry; Problem Solving; Second-Year Undergraduate; Writing,,"F.M.

The release of ChatGPT has generated significant academic and professional interest and instigated a vibrant discussion on the opportunities offered and challenges posed by powerful and readily accessible generative AI reshaping teaching and learning at universities. ChatGPT has reignited an age-old debate on the impact of disruptive technologies on occupations and the labor market, but recent discussions have paid little attention to how university offerings may need to adapt. We strive to open this discussion arguing that while recent GPT technology has, indeed, made more conceivable the substitution of many tasks of white-collar and knowledge workers, and suggested an acceleration of the labor market shift towards technology-centric occupations, it has simultaneously made a stronger-than-ever case for transdisciplinary competences. Consequently, we emphasize the need to foster more transdisciplinary digital literacy in universities with curricula that provide breadth of knowledge and flexibility of mind, bridging humanities with STEM disciplines. Digital humanities education is in a unique position to promote the responsible use of generative AI, while encouraging critical reflection on its socio-cultural embeddedness. © The Author(s) 2023.",chat generative pretrained transformer; digital humanities; digital literacy; Generative artificial intelligence; higher education; labor market readiness; transdisciplinary education,,"V.G.

More recently, LLMs have shown unique potential in numerous applications within medicine but have been particularly investigated for their ability in clinical reasoning. Although the diagnostic accuracy of LLMs in forming differential diagnoses has been reviewed in general internal medicine applications, much is unknown in autoinflammatory disorders. From the nature of autoinflammatory diseases, forming a differential diagnosis is challenging due to the overlapping symptoms between disorders and even more difficult without genetic screening. In this work, the diagnostic accuracy of the Generative Pre-Trained Transformer Model-4 (GPT-4), GPT-3.5, and Large Language Model Meta AI (LLaMa) were evaluated in clinical vignettes of Deficiency of Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist (DIRA) and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). We then compared these models to a control group including one internal medicine physician. It was found that GPT-4 did not significantly differ in correctly identifying DIRA and FMF patients compared to the internist. However, the physician maintained a significantly higher accuracy than GPT-3.5 and LLaMa 2 for either disease.

Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate ChatGPT's ability to understand medical knowledge in Chinese, as well as its potential to serve as an electronic health infrastructure for medical development, by evaluating its performance in medical examinations, records, and education. Method: The Chinese (CNMLE) and English (ENMLE) datasets of the China National Medical Licensing Examination and the Chinese dataset (NEEPM) of the China National Entrance Examination for Postgraduate Clinical Medicine Comprehensive Ability were used to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). We assessed answer accuracy, verbal fluency, and the classification of incorrect responses owing to hallucinations on multiple occasions. In addition, we tested ChatGPT's performance on discharge summaries and group learning in a Chinese context on a small scale. Results: The accuracy of GPT-3.5 in CNMLE, ENMLE, and NEEPM was 56% (56/100), 76% (76/100), and 62% (62/100), respectively, compared to that of GPT-4, which was of 84% (84/100), 86% (86/100), and 82% (82/100). The verbal fluency of all the ChatGPT responses exceeded 95%. Among the GPT-3.5 incorrect responses, the proportions of open-domain hallucinations were 66 % (29/44), 54 % (14/24), and 63 % (24/38), whereas close-domain hallucinations accounted for 34 % (15/44), 46 % (14/24), and 37 % (14/38), respectively. By contrast, GPT-4 open-domain hallucinations accounted for 56% (9/16), 43% (6/14), and 83% (15/18), while close-domain hallucinations accounted for 44% (7/16), 57% (8/14), and 17% (3/18), respectively. In the discharge summary, ChatGPT demonstrated logical coherence, however GPT-3.5 could not fulfill the quality requirements, while GPT-4 met the qualification of 60% (6/10). In group learning, the verbal fluency and interaction satisfaction with ChatGPT were 100% (10/10). Conclusion: ChatGPT based on GPT-4 is at par with Chinese medical practitioners who passed the CNMLE and at the standard required for admission to clinical medical graduate programs in China. The GPT-4 shows promising potential for discharge summarization and group learning. Additionally, it shows high verbal fluency, resulting in a positive human–computer interaction experience. GPT-4 significantly improves multiple capabilities and reduces hallucinations compared to the previous GPT-3.5 model, with a particular leap forward in the Chinese comprehension capability of medical tasks. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems face the challenges of hallucinations, legal risks, and ethical issues. However, we discovered ChatGPT's potential to promote medical development as an electronic health infrastructure, paving the way for Medical AI to become necessary. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",,Artificial Intelligence; China; Clinical Medicine; Electronics; Hallucinations; Humans; Chinese context; Clinical medicine; Discharge summary; Electronic health; Entrance examination; Group learning; Medical fields; Medical knowledge; Performance; Verbal fluencies; Article; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Chinese (language); clinical medicine; comprehension; human; human computer interaction; information processing; learning; licensing; medical education; medical examination; medical record; physician; postgraduate student; satisfaction; artificial intelligence; China; clinical medicine; hallucination; Diagnosis,"L.

The public release of ChatGPT, a generative AI chatbot powered by a large language model (LLM), represents a significant step forward in this direction. Accordingly, professionals predict that this technology will affect education, including the role of teachers. However, despite some assumptions regarding its influence on education, how teachers may actually use the technology and the nature of its relationship with teachers remain under-investigated. Thus, in this study, the relationship between ChatGPT and teachers was explored with a particular focus on identifying the complementary roles of each in education. Eleven language teachers were asked to use ChatGPT for their instruction during a period of two weeks. They then participated in individual interviews regarding their experiences and provided interaction logs produced during their use of the technology. Through qualitative analysis of the data, four ChatGPT roles (interlocutor, content provider, teaching assistant, and evaluator) and three teacher roles (orchestrating different resources with quality pedagogical decisions, making students active investigators, and raising AI ethical awareness) were identified. Based on the findings, an in-depth discussion of teacher-AI collaboration is presented, highlighting the importance of teachers’ pedagogical expertise when using AI tools. Implications regarding the future use of LLM-powered chatbots in education are also provided. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",AIEd; Artificial intelligence; Chatbot; ChatGPT; Human–computer interaction; Large language model; Large language model-powered chatbot,,"S.

The technology presents opportunities as well as, often ethical and legal, challenges, and has the potential for both positive and negative impacts for organisations, society, and individuals. Offering multi-disciplinary insight into some of these, this article brings together 43 contributions from experts in fields such as computer science, marketing, information systems, education, policy, hospitality and tourism, management, publishing, and nursing. The contributors acknowledge ChatGPT's capabilities to enhance productivity and suggest that it is likely to offer significant gains in the banking, hospitality and tourism, and information technology industries, and enhance business activities, such as management and marketing. Nevertheless, they also consider its limitations, disruptions to practices, threats to privacy and security, and consequences of biases, misuse, and misinformation. However, opinion is split on whether ChatGPT's use should be restricted or legislated. Drawing on these contributions, the article identifies questions requiring further research across three thematic areas: knowledge, transparency, and ethics; digital transformation of organisations and societies; and teaching, learning, and scholarly research. The avenues for further research include: identifying skills, resources, and capabilities needed to handle generative AI; examining biases of generative AI attributable to training datasets and processes; exploring business and societal contexts best suited for generative AI implementation; determining optimal combinations of human and generative AI for various tasks; identifying ways to assess accuracy of text produced by generative AI; and uncovering the ethical and legal issues in using generative AI across different contexts. © 2023 The Authors",ChatGPT; Conversational agent; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Large language models,Commerce; Ethical technology; Information management; ChatGPT; Conversational agents; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; In-field; Intelligent tools; Language model; Large language model; Marketing information system; Multidisciplinary perspectives; Marketing,"Y.K.

ChatGPT is an advanced chatbot powered by the Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) architecture, designed to generate human-like conversations encompassing a wide range of knowledge domains. Many AI researchers are currently engaging with the new technology to understand its functionality and limitations. Various expressions across a range of social media platforms, including Twitter, YouTube, Facebook, and numerous others, are currently under investigation. This research seeks to analyze the opinions of ChatGPT users as it regards cybersecurity. This research is important due to its contribution towards gaining enhanced understanding and devising intricate improvements for the chatbot. The Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm is utilized to extract relevant topics from the texts. Additionally, to analyze user opinions and decipher the sentiments as either positive, negative, or neutral, we use the Natural language tool kit Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (NLTK's VADER) and Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (roBERTa) libraries. The data used is obtained from Twitter via the SNScrape library, which aided in the retrieval of over 700,000 tweets via the search terms #chatgptsecurity, #chatgpthackers, #chatgptcybersecurity, and #chatgptcyberthreats. The analysis of the results by the VADER model shows 43.8% positive, 36.3% neutral, and 19.9% negative sentiments. Similarly, the roBERTa model shows 14.1% positive, 53.2% neutral, and 32.7% negative. These results show that there is an ongoing concern about ChatGPT and cybersecurity, especially in malware code generation, hacking, intelligence gathering, and phishing attacks. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Cybersecurity; Data security; Generative pre-trained transformers; Sentiment analysis,Artificial intelligence; Cybersecurity; Malware; Personal computing; Social networking (online); Statistics; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Cyber security; Generative pre-trained transformer; Human like; Knowledge domains; Modeling analyzes; Pre-training; Sentiment analysis; Topic Modeling; Sentiment analysis,"J.H.

Leveraging GANs in medical fields, especially cosmetic surgery, provides a plethora of benefits, including upholding patient confidentiality, ensuring broad exposure to diverse patient scenarios, and democratizing medical education. This study investigated the capacity of AI models, DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Blue Willow, to generate realistic images pertinent to cosmetic surgery. We combined the generative powers of ChatGPT-4 and Google’s BARD with these GANs to produce images of various noses, faces, and eyelids. Four board-certified plastic surgeons evaluated the generated images, eliminating the need for real patient photographs. Notably, generated images predominantly showcased female faces with lighter skin tones, lacking representation of males, older women, and those with a body mass index above 20. The integration of AI in cosmetic surgery offers enhanced patient education and training but demands careful and ethical incorporation to ensure comprehensive representation and uphold medical standards. © 2023 by the authors.",AI; blepharoplasty; cosmetic surgery; facelifts; Generative Adversarial Networks; rhinoplasty,adult; article; artificial intelligence; body mass; ChatGPT; esthetic surgery; eyelid; eyelid reconstruction; female; human; male; medical education; nonhuman; patient education; photography; plastic surgeon; rhinoplasty; skin; willow,"I.

After ChatGPT successfully passed the United States Medical Licensing Examinations, proponents have argued it should play an increasing role in medical service provision and education. AI in healthcare remains in its infancy, and the reliability of AI systems must be scrutinized. This study assessed whether ChatGPT could pass Section 1 of the Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons (FRCS) examination in Trauma and Orthopaedic Surgery. METHODS: The UK and Ireland In-Training Examination (UKITE) was used as a surrogate for the FRCS. Papers 1 and 2 of UKITE 2022 were directly inputted into ChatGPT. All questions were in a single-best-answer format without wording alterations. Imaging was trialled to ensure ChatGPT utilized this information. RESULTS: ChatGPT scored 35.8%: 30% lower than the FRCS pass rate and 8.2% lower than the mean score achieved by human candidates of all training levels. Subspecialty analysis demonstrated ChatGPT scored highest in basic science (53.3%) and lowest in trauma (0%). In 87 questions answered incorrectly, ChatGPT only stated it did not know the answer once and gave incorrect explanatory answers for the remaining questions. CONCLUSION: ChatGPT is currently unable to exert the higher-order judgement and multilogical thinking required to pass the FRCS examination. Further, the current model fails to recognize its own limitations. ChatGPT's deficiencies should be publicized equally as much as its successes to ensure clinicians remain aware of its fallibility. © The Author(s) 2023.

OBJECTIVES: Assess GPT-3.5's ability to craft the background section of critical care clinical research questions compared to medical researchers with H-indices of 22 and 13. DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. SETTING: Researchers from 20 countries from six continents evaluated the backgrounds. PARTICIPANTS: Researchers with a Scopus index greater than 1 were included. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: In this study, we generated a background section of a critical care clinical research question on ""acute kidney injury in sepsis""using three different methods: researcher with H-index greater than 20, researcher with H-index greater than 10, and GPT-3.5. The three background sections were presented in a blinded survey to researchers with an H-index range between 1 and 96. First, the researchers evaluated the main components of the background using a 5-point Likert scale. Second, they were asked to identify which background was written by humans only or with large language model-generated tools. RESULTS: A total of 80 researchers completed the survey. The median H-index was 3 (interquartile range, 1-7.25) and most (36%) researchers were from the Critical Care specialty. When compared with researchers with an H-index of 22 and 13, GPT-3.5 was marked high on the Likert scale ranking on main background components (median 4.5 vs. 3.82 vs. 3.6 vs. 4.5, respectively; p < 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity to detect researchers writing versus GPT-3.5 writing were poor, 22.4% and 57.6%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: GPT-3.5 could create background research content indistinguishable from the writing of a medical researcher. It was marked higher compared with medical researchers with an H-index of 22 and 13 in writing the background section of a critical care clinical research question.  © 2021 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

As the latter one, we show a dialogue system named Terabot, which was used in the therapy of psychiatric patients. Our study was motivated by the fact that for such a domain-specific system, it was difficult to acquire large real-life data samples to increase the training database: this would require recruiting more patients, which is both time-consuming and costly. To address this gap, we have employed a neural large language model: ChatGPT version 3.5, to generate data solely for training our dialogue system. During initial experiments, we identified intents that were most often misrecognized. Next, we fed ChatGPT with a series of prompts, which triggered the language model to generate numerous additional training entries, e.g., alternatives to the phrases that had been collected during initial experiments with healthy users. This way, we have enlarged the training dataset by 112%. In our case study, for testing, we used 2802 speech recordings originating from 32 psychiatric patients. As an evaluation metric, we used the accuracy of intent recognition. The speech samples were converted into text using automatic speech recognition (ASR). The analysis showed that the patients’ speech challenged the ASR module significantly, resulting in deteriorated speech recognition and, consequently, low accuracy of intent recognition. However, thanks to the augmentation of the training data with ChatGPT-generated data, the intent recognition accuracy increased by 13% relatively, reaching 86% in total. We also emulated the case of an error-free ASR and showed the impact of ASR misrecognitions on the intent recognition accuracy.

In this paper, we aimed to explore the potential of AI in the future of education with the analytical method of evolutionary game analysis (EGA). By studying the behavior of two agents, the school and the students, EGA can be used to identify strategies that can be used to improve the effectiveness of the education model in the context of the AI era. A stable evolutionary strategy for the school and students was devised under a variety of scenarios. Additionally, we conducted a numerical analysis to further explore the impact of several key factors on the stable strategy. The results indicated that schools should adopt positive supervision to standardize the use of AI in education, and students should be more active in becoming involved in AI technology.

Nonetheless, despite its impressive capabilities, various reports on ChatGPT have consistently revealed significant remaining challenges (Bang et al., 2023). This study aims to explain the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT. A qualitative approach was conducted. In-depth interviews were used with ten key informants, employing purposive sampling. Content analysis and NVivo were utilised to analyse the data. The findings revealed that ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) tool that has the potential to revolutionise the way we communicate. This artificial intelligence (AI) technology can generate text, allowing users to easily create personalised content, and it has gained widespread popularity. However, the reaction has been mixed, with praise for its benefits and potential applications offset by criticism of its limitations and potential drawbacks. Furthermore, ChatGPT is an extremely effective tool. However, it cannot replace human thought and, if not properly fine-tuned, it has the potential to produce biased or insulting content.

Methods: In this multicenter study, five AI models were investigated for restoring low-count whole-body PET/MRI, covering convolutional benchmarks — U-Net, enhanced deep super-resolution network (EDSR), generative adversarial network (GAN) — and the most cutting-edge image reconstruction transformer models in computer vision to date — Swin transformer image restoration network (SwinIR) and EDSR-ViT (vision transformer). The models were evaluated against six groups of count levels representing the simulated 75%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, and 1% (extremely ultra-low-count) of the clinical standard 3 MBq/kg 18F-FDG dose. The comparisons were performed upon two independent cohorts — (1) a primary cohort from Stanford University and (2) a cross-continental external validation cohort from Tübingen University — in order to ensure the findings are generalizable. A total of 476 original count and simulated low-count whole-body PET/MRI scans were incorporated into this analysis. Results: For low-count PET restoration on the primary cohort, the mean structural similarity index (SSIM) scores for dose 6.25% were 0.898 (95% CI, 0.887–0.910) for EDSR, 0.893 (0.881–0.905) for EDSR-ViT, 0.873 (0.859–0.887) for GAN, 0.885 (0.873–0.898) for U-Net, and 0.910 (0.900–0.920) for SwinIR. In continuation, SwinIR and U-Net’s performances were also discreetly evaluated at each simulated radiotracer dose levels. Using the primary Stanford cohort, the mean diagnostic image quality (DIQ; 5-point Likert scale) scores of SwinIR restoration were 5 (SD, 0) for dose 75%, 4.50 (0.535) for dose 50%, 3.75 (0.463) for dose 25%, 3.25 (0.463) for dose 12.5%, 4 (0.926) for dose 6.25%, and 2.5 (0.534) for dose 1%. Conclusion: Compared to low-count PET images, with near-to or nondiagnostic images at higher dose reduction levels (up to 6.25%), both SwinIR and U-Net significantly improve the diagnostic quality of PET images. A radiotracer dose reduction to 1% of the current clinical standard radiotracer dose is out of scope for current AI techniques. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",CNN; Deep learning; PET restoration; Transformer model; Whole-body PET imaging,"Artificial Intelligence; Drug Tapering; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Positron-Emission Tomography; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adolescent; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; basal ganglion; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; computer vision; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; enhanced deep super resolution network; false negative result; false positive result; female; follow up; gated recurrent unit network; generative adversarial network; Hodgkin disease; human; image processing; image quality; image reconstruction; image segmentation; male; maximum standardized uptake value; mean structural similarity index; natural language processing; nonhodgkin lymphoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease; radiation dose reduction; radiation exposure; receptive field; residual neural network; retrospective study; scoring system; signal noise ratio; standardized uptake value; tumor metabolism; validation study; visual information; whole body PET; clinical trial; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; procedures","Y.-R.J.

However, some commentators have pointed out that generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT can enhance student learning, and consequently, academics should adapt their teaching and assessment practices to embrace the new reality of living, working, and studying in a world where AI is freely available. Despite this important debate, there has been very little academic literature published on ChatGPT and other generative AI tools. This article uses content analysis to examine news articles (N=100) about how ChatGPT is disrupting higher education, concentrating specifically on Australia, New Zealand, the United States, and the United Kingdom. It explores several key themes, including university responses, academic integrity concerns, the limitations and weaknesses of AI tool outputs, and opportunities for student learning. The data reveals mixed public discussion and university responses, with a focus mainly on academic integrity concerns and opportunities for innovative assessment design. There has also been a lack of public discussion about the potential for ChatGPT to enhance participation and success for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Similarly, the student voice is poorly represented in media articles to date. This article considers these trends and the impact of AI tools on student learning at university. © 2023.

Very recent work has shown that Codex performs considerably better on typical CS1 exam questions than most students. It is not clear, however, what Codex's limits are with regard to more complex programming assignments and exams. In this paper, we present results detailing how Codex performs on more advanced CS2 (data structures and algorithms) exam questions taken from past exams.

The specific focus is on classroom layout design, which is investigated regarding implementation of ML in the early phases of design. Design/methodology/approach: This study introduces the framework of the EDU-AI, which adopts generative adversarial networks (GAN) architecture and Pix2Pix method. The processes of data collection, data set preparation, training, validation and evaluation for the proposed model are presented. The ML model is trained over two coupled data sets of classroom layouts extracted from a typical school project database of the Ministry of National Education of the Republic of Turkey and validated with foreign classroom boundaries. The generated classroom layouts are objectively evaluated through the structural similarity method (SSIM). Findings: The implementation of EDU-AI generates classroom layouts despite the use of a small data set. Objective evaluations show that EDU-AI can provide satisfactory outputs for given classroom boundaries regardless of shape complexity (reserved for validation and newly synthesized). Originality/value: EDU-AI specifically contributes to the automation of classroom layout generation using ML-based algorithms. EDU-AI’s two-step framework enables the generation of zoning for any given classroom boundary and furnishing for the previously generated zone. EDU-AI can also be used in the early design phase of school projects in other countries. It can be adapted to the architectural typologies involving footprint, zoning and furnishing relations. © 2022, Ilker Karadag, Orkan Zeynel Güzelci and Sema Alaçam.",Architectural design; Artificial intelligence; Classroom layout; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Plan layout generation,Architectural design; Data acquisition; Zoning; Classroom layout; Data set; Educational buildings; Layout designs; Layout generations; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Plan layout; Plan layout generation; School project; Generative adversarial networks,"O.Z.

By now, COVID-19 has affected practically every facet of progress, most importantly, it has shaken the healthcare system like never before. At its peak, it forced Governments throughout the world into lockdowns to limit the reach of the epidemic. Based on early advisories of the World Health Organization (WHO), the only method of safeguarding oneself from being infected was to wear a face mask. Even today, with fewer cases being reported, masking oneself remains the single most effective and cheap means of prevention. As urban areas continue to grow, effective city management is essential for mitigating the increase of the deadly COVID-19 disease. The success of smart cities depends on significant upgrades to public transportation, highways, companies, homes, and municipal streets. There is room for improvement in the public bus transportation system now in place, and one of those improvements would be to use artificial intelligence. To determine if the person is wearing a face mask, you need an autonomous mask detection and alert system. Therefore, this study introduced a deep learning-based design that combines the attention-based generative adversarial network (ABGAN) with the multi-objective interactive honeybee mating optimization (MOIHBMO) approach to create an automated face mask recognition system. A set of 1386 images has been used to create a real-time dataset. This database contains 690 pictures without face masks and 686 images with them. The suggested algorithm ABGAN-MOIHBMO is compared to other traditional methods for detection of face masks, such as DL, AI, and DNN. The performance indicators used are error rate, inference speed, precision, recall, accuracy, and over fitting assessments. The results demonstrate that the proposed ABGAN-MOIHBMO outperforms the existing methodologies. It provides 96% of precision, 86% of recall, 93% for the f1 score, which are higher/better than the other, traditional methods. The error rate in ABGAN-MOIHBMO is a low 1.1%, which is lower other approaches. To predict and underline the significance of face mask use, the face mask detection technique may be employed in the future at Saudi airports, shopping centers, and other congested locations. On a larger platform, our research will be an effective instrument in helping many nations throughout the globe combat the rapid spread of this contagious illness. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.",ABGAN; COVID-19; MOIHBMO algorithm; smart cities; transportation system,,"M.S.I.

Many features they developed can be inspirational and beneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a specific form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although BID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and engineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the method. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence (AI) for a data-driven approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a generative design approach based on the generative pre-trained language model (PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in the form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer, namely generative pre-trained transformer 3 (GPT-3), is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators are identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the problem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess the mapping relevancy between the domains within the generated BID concepts. The approach is evaluated and then employed in a real-world project of designing light-weighted flying cars during its conceptual design phase The results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.

This accelerated pace of change is drastically transforming various aspects of our lives and work, resulting in what is now known as Industry 4.0. As businesses integrate these technologies into their daily operations, it significantly impacts their work tasks and required skill sets. However, the approach to technological transformation varies depending on location, industry, and organization. However, there are no published methods that can adequately forecast the adoption of technology and its impact on society. It is essential to prepare for the future impact of Industry 4.0, and this requires policymakers and business leaders to be equipped with scientifically validated models and metrics. Data-driven scenario planning and decision-making can lead to better outcomes in every area of the business, from learning and development to technology investment. However, the current literature falls short in identifying effective and globally applicable strategies to predict the adoption rate of emerging technologies. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel parametric mathematical model for predicting the adoption rate of emerging technologies through a unique data-driven pipeline. This approach utilizes global indicators for countries to predict the technology adoption curves for each country and industry.

However, researchers embracing applied machine learning (ML) in pedagogical settings continue to face challenges. Lack of publicly available multimodal datasets involving gesture and emotion recognition specifically in education is a bottleneck for building AI-enabled e-learning platforms. In the paper, we take a constructive stance at monitoring group behavior in cyber peer-led team learning (cPLTL) classes in Organic Chemistry using ML. Although past studies have attempted to quantify student engagement in e-learning, their use in the cPLTL use case for AI modeling has not yet been established. The hypothesis underlying our proposed framework is that online peer group behavior can be characterized by a human-in-the-loop model that relies on multiple input modalities. Thus, the aim is to identify behavioral patterns in head and facial movements that are augmented by lexical based sentiment and audio feature extraction. To combat the small data challenge, we propose a framework for the human-in-the-loop (HITL) system that actively learns the past group modalities. HITL strategies enable the algorithm to learn more efficiently from less data iteratively. The model will be implemented using active learning, measures of uncertainty, random sampling and entropy which are key in the design of the study.

The authors provide background on these emerging, artificially intelligent tools, and explore, with special emphasis on scenarios, a specific tool named “Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer” (hereafter, ChatGPT). The authors examine the utility of scenarios generated by artificial intelligence (AI) and explore whether or not the futures and foresight prac-ademic community should selectively embrace advances in AI to assist in the generation of scenarios. In particular, the authors will consider (1) the utility of using scenarios generated completely by AI, (2) whether what is produced, in fact, constitute scenarios, based on conventional definitions, and (3) assess the utility of using AI to assist in the production of scenarios. At this point in time, artificially intelligent tools can now generate numerous scenarios on seemingly any topic at essentially zero cost to the user. Still, the authors insist that the utility of those scenarios is largely predicated on the user's ability to coax the appropriate “raw material” from the artificially intelligent bot, which implicates, the authors contend, that such bots can usefully provide base material for the development of scenarios but are unlikely to fully eclipse scenarists in the production of scenarios. Additionally, the authors recommend that the futures and foresight prac-ademic community pay especially close attention to artificially intelligent tools for novel insights with regard to the differences in human cognition and, in this case, the logic of large language model outputs. © 2023 The Authors.

The rapid pace of technological advancements, economic transformations, and changes in workplace practices necessitate that employees continuously adapt to new skill requirements. A quick assessment of these changes enables the identification of skill profiles and the activities of economic fields. This paper aims to utilize natural language processing technologies and data clustering methods to analyze the skill needs of Lithuanian employees, perform a cluster analysis of these skills, and create automated job profiles. The hypothesis that applying natural language processing and clustering in job profile analyzes can allow the real-time assessment of job skill demand changes was investigated. Over five hundred thousand job postings were analyzed to build job/position profiles for further decision-making. In the first stage, data were extracted from the job requirements of entire job advertisement texts. The regex procedure was found to have demonstrated the best results. Data vectorization for initial feature extraction was performed using BERT structure transformers (sentence transformers). Five dimensionality reduction methods were compared, with the UMAP technique producing the best results. The HDBSCAN method proved to be the most effective for clustering, though RCBMIDE also demonstrated a robust performance. Finally, job profile descriptions were generated using generative artificial intelligence based on the compiled job profile skills. Upon expert assessment of the created job profiles and their descriptions, it was concluded that the automated job advertisement analysis algorithm had shown successful results and could therefore be applied in practice. © 2023 by the authors.",clustering; generative AI; GPT; jobs requirements; machine learning; natural language processing; NLP,,"M.

Unanalyzed data creates missed opportunities to improve health outcomes. Natural language processing (NLP) is the foundation of generative artificial intelligence (GAI), which is the basis for large language models, such as ChatGPT. NLP and GAI are machine learning methods that analyze large amounts of data in a short time at minimal cost. The ability of NLP to conduct qualitative analyses is increasing, yet the results can lack context and nuance in their findings, requiring human intervention. Methods: Our study compared outcomes, time, and costs of a previously published qualitative study. Our approach partnered an NLP model and a qualitative researcher (NLP+). UD from behavioral health patients were analyzed using NLP and a Latent Dirichlet allocation to identify the topics using probability of word coherence scores. The topics were then analyzed by a qualitative researcher, translated into themes, and compared with the original findings. Results: The NLP + method results aligned with the original, qualitative derived themes. Our model also identified two additional themes which were not originally detected. The NLP + method required 6 hours of labor, 3 minutes for transcription, and a transcription cost of $1.17. The original, qualitative researcher only method required more than 36 hours ($2,250) of time and $1,100 for transcription. Conclusions: While natural language processing analyzes voluminous amounts of data in seconds, context and nuance in human language are regularly missed. Combining a qualitative researcher with NLP + could be deployed in many settings, reducing time and costs, and improving context. Until large language models are more prevalent, a human interaction can help translate the patient experience by contextualizing data rich in social determinant indicators which may otherwise go unanalyzed. © The Author(s) 2023.",healthcare; natural language processing; qualitative research; unstructured data,,"R.D.

It is still a new concept and approach for many stakeholders. ChatGPT, a generative pre-trained transformer, is an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot based on a complex network structure and trained by the company OpenAI. It has the potential for the fast learning of PED. This paper reports a trial test in which ChatGPT is used to provide written formulations of PEDs within three frameworks: challenge, impact, and communication and dissemination. The results are compared with the formulations derived from over 80 PED experts who took part in a two-day workshop discussing many aspects of PED research and development. The proposed methodology involves querying ChatGPT with specific questions and recording its responses. Subsequently, expert opinions on the same questions are provided to ChatGPT, aiming to elicit a comparison between the two sources of information. This approach enables an evaluation of ChatGPT’s answers in relation to the insights shared by domain experts. By juxtaposing the outputs, a comprehensive assessment can be made regarding the reliability, accuracy, and alignment of ChatGPT’s responses with expert viewpoints. It is found that ChatGPT can be a useful tool for the rapid formulation of basic information about PEDs that could be used for its wider dissemination amongst the general public. The model is also noted as having a number of limitations, such as providing pre-set single answers, a sensitivity to the phrasing of questions, a tendency to repeat non-important (or general) information, and an inability to assess inputs negatively or provide diverse answers to context-based questions. Its answers were not always based on up-to-date information. Other limitations and some of the ethical–social issues related to the use of ChatGPT are also discussed. This study not only validated the possibility of using ChatGPT to rapid study PEDs but also trained ChatGPT by feeding back the experts’ discussion into the tool. It is recommended that ChatGPT can be involved in real-time PED meetings or workshops so that it can be trained both iteratively and dynamically. © 2023 by the authors.",challenge; ChatGPT; communication and dissemination; impact; PED,,"X.

This research paper focuses on the adaptability of LLMs to the Odia language, spoken by approximately 50 million people in India. With a primary objective to cater to the Odia-speaking community, we aim to evaluate existing LLM models such as ChatGPT, and Olive, an instruction following Odia LLM, specifically in the context of generating conversational outputs in Odia. We employ a critical evaluation approach to assess the performance, language understanding, and response generation capabilities of the LLM models for the Odia language. By conducting experiments and comparative analysis, we seek to determine the strengths, weaknesses, and potential areas of improvement for the existing LLM models. Our findings will contribute to the development of more effective and contextually accurate generative chatbots for the Odia language, enabling better communication and accessibility for the Odia-speaking population.  © 2023 IEEE.",ChatGPT; Generative AI; Large Language Models (LLM); Natural language Processing (NLP); Odia; OdiaGenAI,Computational linguistics; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Generative artificial intelligence; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Odia; Odiagenai; Natural language processing systems,"S.R.

The chatbot is integrated with large language models (LLM) and machine learning models (ML) on the cloud and based on questions asked by user it provides answers in conversational settings. Chatbot is hosted in cloud and is integrated with various databases, document repositories and several machine learning model. The machine learning models are built to enable chatbot's capability to answer questions related to drilling and production analytics. Chatbot is integrated with user interface where user can type or ask questions. Using natural language process (NLP) and artificial intelligence (Al), chatbot understands intent of question and if needed asks relevant follow-up questions to provide the answer. Chatbot can also perform statistical analysis, generate SQL queries on datasets and can use those statistics to answer questions. Further if enabled, chatbot can also search information from drilling and production reports and scientific articles. Three case studies are presented. In case study#1, chatbot was integrated with operator's historical PDF drilling reports (Volve dataset), which traditionally are not easy to extract and analyze at scale. Several thousand drilling reports were extracted and stored in database. Various capabilities were added to chatbot such has Cross-documents insights and trend, for example, well progression, operation history, can be generated and displayed on user interface and further analysis can be performed in conversational manner. The dataset created was used to perform comparative analysis identifying wells having significant higher non production time (NPT) due to repair or fishing events. In this manner, chatbot can compare one well's operational statistics with other well and generate various visuals which helps identifying possible ways to improve drilling operations. Similarly, chatbot was also trained to provide answers for production diagnostics such as comparing well's relative performances and root cause identification for poor performing wells. When analyzed on test dataset chatbot was able to identify 20% uplift in production for wells supported on plunger lift. Finally, chatbot was enabled to support NLP based searches. Engineers can ask specific questions such as ""provide operational log for well F4 when fishing happened and sort the result by reporting date in ascending order. Show me both SQL query and the resulted table"" and chatbot will generate SQL query and resulted table. The work demonstrates that generative AI has great potential to transform the Energy industry. © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,Data Analytics; Database systems; Infill drilling; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Query processing; Statistical tests; User interfaces; Business segments; Case-studies; Chatbots; End to end; Energy companies; Large amounts; Machine learning models; Natural language process; Production report; SQL query; Large dataset,,,Society of Petroleum Engineers,,978-195902507-8,,,English,"Soc.

Large language models (LLMs), a form of AI, are capable of generating high-quality, humanlike text. We investigate the persuasive quality of AI-generated messages to understand how AI could impact public health messaging. Specifically, through a series of studies designed to characterize and evaluate generative AI in developing public health messages, we analyze COVID-19 pro-vaccination messages generated by GPT-3, a state-of-the-art instantiation of a large language model. Study 1 is a systematic evaluation of GPT-3's ability to generate pro-vaccination messages. Study 2 then observed peoples' perceptions of curated GPT-3-generated messages compared to human-authored messages released by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), finding that GPT-3 messages were perceived as more effective, stronger arguments, and evoked more positive attitudes than CDC messages. Finally, Study 3 assessed the role of source labels on perceived quality, finding that while participants preferred AI-generated messages, they expressed dispreference for messages that were labeled as AI-generated. The results suggest that, with human supervision, AI can be used to create effective public health messages, but that individuals prefer their public health messages to come from human institutions rather than AI sources. We propose best practices for assessing generative outputs of large language models in future social science research and ways health professionals can use AI systems to augment public health messaging.  © 2023 ACM.",AI-mediated communication; large language models; message factors; natural language processing; persuasion; public health messaging,Computational linguistics; Diseases; Natural language processing systems; Text messaging; Vaccines; Artificial intelligence-mediated communication; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Mediated Communication; Message factor; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Persuasion; Public health messaging; Disease control,,,Association for Computing Machinery,25730142,,,,English,Proc.

This study assessed irradiation indication lists generated by multiple artificial intelligence (AI) programs, or chatbots, and compared them to 2020 British Society for Haematology (BSH) practice guidelines. Four chatbots (ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, Bard, and Bing Chat) were prompted to list the indications for irradiation to prevent TA-GVHD. Responses were graded for concordance with BSH guidelines. Chatbot response length, discrepancies, and omissions were noted. Chatbot responses differed, but all were relevant, short in length, generally more concordant than discordant with BSH guidelines, and roughly complete. They lacked several indications listed in BSH guidelines and notably differed in their irradiation eligibility criteria for fetuses and neonates. The chatbots variably listed erroneous indications for TA-GVHD prevention, such as patients receiving blood from a donor who is of a different race or ethnicity.

Models such as OpenAI Codex can take natural language problem descriptions as input and generate highly accurate source code solutions, with potentially significant implications for computing education. Given the many complexities that students face when learning to write code, they may quickly become reliant on such tools without properly understanding the underlying concepts. One popular approach for scaffolding the code writing process is to use Parsons problems, which present solution lines of code in a scrambled order. These remove the complexities of low-level syntax, and allow students to focus on algorithmic and design-level problem solving. It is unclear how well code generation models can be applied to solve Parsons problems, given the mechanics of these models and prior evidence that they underperform when problems include specific restrictions. In this paper, we explore the performance of the Codex model for solving Parsons problems over various prompt variations. Using a corpus of Parsons problems we sourced from the computing education literature, we find that Codex successfully reorders the problem blocks about half of the time, a much lower rate of success when compared to prior work on more free-form programming tasks. Regarding prompts, we find that small variations in prompting have a noticeable effect on model performance, although the effect is not as pronounced as between different problems.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",academic integrity; ai; artificial intelligence; chatgpt; code generation; code writing; codex; computer programming; copilot; CS1; deep learning; generative ai; GitHub; GPT-3; introductory programming; large language models; machine learning; ML; natural language processing; neural networks; novice programming; openAI,Codes (symbols); Computer programming; Deep learning; Education computing; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Scaffolds; Students; Academic integrity; Ai; Chatgpt; Code-writing; Codegeneration; Codex; Copilot; Deep learning; Generative ai; Github; GPT-3; Introductory programming; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Machine-learning; ML; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Neural-networks; Novice programming; Openai; Neural networks,,,Association for Computing Machinery,1942647X,979-840070138-2,,,English,Annu.

Education, being one of them, is now pressed to establish reactive policies on the use of this technology, often without enough insight and data. Thus, we present a dataset of authentic coursework (including long-form theses and short assignments) from a public high school in the Czech Republic, extended by AI-generated alternatives with various versions of ChatGPT. To evaluate their quality, we enlist a group of student peers from the same school and conduct multiple assessments. Our findings reveal that ChatGPT can generate high-quality, high school-level coursework off-the-shelf, even in a low-resourced language such as Czech. Additionally, we demonstrate that the AI text detectors, which are gradually being implemented in educational institutions and learning centers worldwide, fail to identify these AI-generated texts. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Physicians and academicians frequently make customized education materials for their patients. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based writer can help them write an article. Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT) is a conversational language model developed by OpenAI (openai.com). The model can generate human-like responses. Objective: We aimed to evaluate the generated text from ChatGPT for its suitability in patients' education. Materials and Methods: We asked the ChatGPT to list common dermatological diseases. It provided a list of 14 diseases. We used the disease names to converse with the application with disease-specific input (e.g., write a patient education guide on acne). The text was copied for checking the number of words, readability, and text similarity by software. The text's accuracy was checked by a dermatologist following the structure of observed learning outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy. For the readability ease score, we compared the observed value with a score of 30. For the similarity index, we compared the observed value with 15% and tested it with a one-sample t-test. Results: The ChatGPT generated a paragraph of text of 377.43 ± 60.85 words for a patient education guide on skin diseases. The average text reading ease score was 46.94 ± 8.23 (P < 0.0001), and it indicates that this level of text can easily be understood by a high-school student to a newly joined college student. The text similarity index was higher (27.07 ± 11.46%, P = 0.002) than the expected limit of 15%. The text had a 'relational' level of accuracy according to the SOLO taxonomy. Conclusion: In its current form, ChatGPT can generate a paragraph of text for patients' educational purposes that can be easily understood. However, the similarity index is high. Hence, doctors should be cautious when using the text generated by ChatGPT and must check for text similarity before using it. © 2023 Indian Dermatology Online Journal.

These rapid developments impact higher education, as millions of students and academics have started using bots like ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Bard, Ernie and others for a large variety of purposes. In this article, we select some of the most promising chatbots in the English and Chinese-language spaces and provide their corporate backgrounds and brief histories. Following an up-to-date review of the Chinese and English-language academic literature, we describe our comparative method and systematically compare selected chatbots across a multi-disciplinary test relevant to higher education. The results of our test show that there are currently no A-students and no B-students in this bot cohort, despite all publicised and sensationalist claims to the contrary. The much-vaunted AI is not yet that intelligent, it would appear. GPT-4 and its predecessor did best, whilst Bing Chat and Bard were akin to at-risk students with F-grade averages.

Recent advances in AI development illustrate the future potential of generative AI technologies, including those based on Large LanguageModels (LLMs). In a medical context, AI systems with different degrees of generativity are conceivable. These AI systems can pose new types of risks that are specific to AI technologies, as well as more traditional risks that are typical of medical devices. The proposed AIA is intended to address AI-specific risks foreseen by the EU legislature, whereas the MDR addresses more traditional medical risks. Through two case studies which display different degrees of generativity, this article identifies regulatory lacunae in the intersection between the AIA and the MDR. The article suggests that the emerging regulatory framework for medical AI systems potentially leaves certain AI-specific risks as well as certain typical medical device risks unregulated.

However, there is a lack of research on its performance in low-income countries’ national licensing medical examinations. In Peru, where almost one out of three examinees fails the national licensing medical examination, ChatGPT has the potential to enhance medical education. Objective: We aimed to assess the accuracy of ChatGPT using GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 on the Peruvian National Licensing Medical Examination (Examen Nacional de Medicina [ENAM]). Additionally, we sought to identify factors associated with incorrect answers provided by ChatGPT. Methods: We used the ENAM 2022 data set, which consisted of 180 multiple-choice questions, to evaluate the performance of ChatGPT. Various prompts were used, and accuracy was evaluated. The performance of ChatGPT was compared to that of a sample of 1025 examinees. Factors such as question type, Peruvian-specific knowledge, discrimination, difficulty, quality of questions, and subject were analyzed to determine their influence on incorrect answers. Questions that received incorrect answers underwent a three-step process involving different prompts to explore the potential impact of adding roles and context on ChatGPT’s accuracy. Results: GPT-4 achieved an accuracy of 86% on the ENAM, followed by GPT-3.5 with 77%. The accuracy obtained by the 1025 examinees was 55%. There was a fair agreement (κ=0.38) between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moderate-to-high-difficulty questions were associated with incorrect answers in the crude and adjusted model for GPT-3.5 (odds ratio [OR] 6.6, 95% CI 2.73-15.95) and GPT-4 (OR 33.23, 95% CI 4.3-257.12). After reinputting questions that received incorrect answers, GPT-3.5 went from 41 (100%) to 12 (29%) incorrect answers, and GPT-4 from 25 (100%) to 4 (16%). Conclusions: Our study found that ChatGPT (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) can achieve expert-level performance on the ENAM, outperforming most of our examinees.

This study built artificial intelligence (AI) models to automatically identify and correct news headlines exaggerating obesity-related research findings. Design/methodology/approach: We searched popular digital media outlets to collect 523 headlines exaggerating obesity-related research findings. The reasons for exaggerations include: inferring causality from observational studies, inferring human outcomes from animal research, inferring distant/end outcomes (e.g., obesity) from immediate/intermediate outcomes (e.g., calorie intake), and generalizing findings to the population from a subgroup or convenience sample. Each headline was paired with the title and abstract of the peer-reviewed journal publication covered by the news article. We drafted an exaggeration-free counterpart for each original headline and fined-Tuned a BERT model to differentiate between them. We further fine-Tuned three generative language models-BART, PEGASUS, and T5 to autogenerate exaggeration-free headlines based on a journal publication's title and abstract. Model performance was evaluated using the ROUGE metrics by comparing model-generated headlines with journal publication titles. Findings: The fine-Tuned BERT model achieved 92.5% accuracy in differentiating between exaggeration-free and original headlines. Baseline ROUGE scores averaged 0.311 for ROUGE-1, 0.113 for ROUGE-2, 0.253 for ROUGE-L, and 0.253 ROUGE-Lsum. PEGASUS, T5, and BART all outperformed the baseline. The best-performing BART model attained 0.447 for ROUGE-1, 0.221 for ROUGE-2, 0.402 for ROUGE-L, and 0.402 for ROUGE-Lsum. Originality/value: This study demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging AI to automatically identify and correct news headlines exaggerating obesity-related research findings.  © 2023 Ruopeng An et al., published by Sciendo.",Artificial intelligence; Deep neural networks; Exaggeration; Headlines; News; Obesity,,"J.

Consequently, there exist three primary Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, namely Analytical AI, Cognitive AI, and Generative AI. Analytical AI is primarily concerned with comprehending the data and transforming it into contextualized data and knowledge. On the other hand, Cognitive AI is centered on understanding experience and aims to annotate, enrich, and utilize the knowledge, to facilitate decision-making. Lastly, Generative AI delves into the neural mechanisms involved in creative thinking and problem-solving, with a focus on enhancing the process of acquiring and applying knowledge and skills. This paper presents Knowledge Base 4.0 as the backend data for AI engines, which allows for linking knowledge and experience to enable empowering generative AI. The objective is not only to facilitate generating new content (such as text and images) but also to generate new processes when/if needed. We present the architecture of Knowledge Base 4.0 and the design and development of data services that construct and maintain this robust Knowledge Base. Additionally, we provide use cases in various domains, including health, policing, banking, and education. © 2023 IEEE.",Business Processes Automation; Crowdsourcing; Generative AI; Knowledge Base; weak supervision,Cognitive systems; Decision making; Knowledge based systems; Metadata; Artificial intelligence systems; Business process automation; Creative thinking; Decisions makings; Fundamental component; Generative artificial intelligence; Knowledge base; Neural mechanisms; Problem-solving; Weak supervision; Crowdsourcing,"A.

While people are getting very excited about impressive capabilities of this technology in creating textual content such as letters, reports and essays, there are concerns about the originality of the content produced by GAI, especially in the higher education sector. In response to this concern, this study takes an initial step through examining the originality reports of 60 essays generated by 5 different GAIs, namely, ChatGPT, YouChat, Chatosonic AI, Perplexity AI, and ChatGenie. To collect data, the study first chose one topic from each of four subject areas, namely, social science, mental health, organizational studies and computer science. Next, each of the 5 above-mentioned GAIs were asked to generate essays of 200, 500 and 1000 words for each topic, resulting in a total of 60 essays which were then submitted to the Turnitin plagiarism detection software. The results showed that while 16 essays were found to be plagiarism free, the other 44 had certain amount of plagiarism ranging from 3% to 47%. A correlation was observed between the word count of the text generated by GAI and the plagiarism percentage, with lower word counts showing a higher plagiarism percentage.

Much of the research focuses on how this – and similar – tools can be leveraged for effective education of undergraduate coursework students. In this study, we explore the emerging benefits and limitations of ChatGPT and LLMs in the context of undergraduate and postgraduate research supervision. What we found was that psychological need fulfilment, research student autonomy and relatedness were key outcomes that could be cultivated at the student level. At a unit or subject level, the opportunity for formative feedback was seen as a strength. We also discuss some key limitations to the tool, including how limited its ability to deconstruct social injustice and generate content appropriate to context. We used an example of leadership research to highlight that it may preference good outcomes and likewise present information related to current and normative practices rather than desired future practices. We conclude by considering the broad implications of this work on research supervision relationships. Implications for practice or policy: • ChatGPT has the ability to enhance research higher degree research practices. • AI and LLMs may support student psychological need fulfilment, autonomy, competence and relatedness. • ChatGPT could provide preliminary formative feedback support for research and doctoral students prior to submitting drafts to supervisory teams. • Policy safeguards are needed to ensure research responses to lack of context, data bias, equity concerns and lack of an ethical framework. © (2023), (Australasian Society for Computers in Learning in Tertiary Education (ASCILITE)).

LLMs use deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new text. LLMs caught the public eye in early 2023 when ChatGPT (the first consumer facing LLM) was released. LLM technologies are driven by recent advances in deep-learning AI techniques, where language models are trained on extremely large text data from the internet and then re-used for downstream tasks with limited fine-tuning required. They offer exciting opportunities for evaluators to automate and accelerate time-consuming tasks involving text analytics and text generation. We estimate that over two-thirds of evaluation tasks will be affected by LLMs in the next 5 years. Use-case examples include summarizing text data, extracting key information from text, analyzing and classifying text content, writing text, and translation. Despite the advances, the technologies pose significant challenges and risks. Because LLM technologies are generally trained on text from the internet, they tend to perpetuate biases (racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, and more) and exclusion of non-majority languages. Current tools like ChatGPT have not been specifically developed for monitoring, evaluation, research, and learning (MERL) purposes, possibly limiting their accuracy and usefulness for evaluation. In addition, technical limitations and challenges with bias can lead to real world harm. To overcome these technical challenges and ethical risks, the evaluation community will need to work collaboratively with the data science community to co-develop tools and processes and to ensure the application of quality and ethical standards. © 2023 American Evaluation Association and Wiley Periodicals LLC.",,,"L.

But poetry will not optimize; the creative process cannot be reduced to a prompt. Some have noted that literary creations generated or augmented by artificial intelligence at best can offer form without meaning; using a GPT creation prompted by Maya Angelou’s poem “Still I Rise” as a case study, this essay argues that NLP’s predictive language generation and what I call algorithmic ahistoricity can also, more disturbingly, render meaning senseless. In doing so, GPT-3’s literary experiments are not “failed” because they do not meet some moving target of a literary standard, nor because of technological insufficiency, but because it can make it harder for people to name and navigate their realities.

ChatGPT—a generative language model with many medical applications due to its creativity, memory, and accuracy—can help students in this transition. Objective: This paper models ChatGPT 3.5’s ability to perform interactive clinical simulations and shows this tool’s benefit to medical education. Methods: Simulation starting prompts were refined using ChatGPT 3.5 in Google Chrome. Starting prompts were selected based on assessment format, stepwise progression of simulation events and questions, free-response question type, responsiveness to user inputs, postscenario feedback, and medical accuracy of the feedback. The chosen scenarios were advanced cardiac life support and medical intensive care (for sepsis and pneumonia). Results: Two starting prompts were chosen. Prompt 1 was developed through 3 test simulations and used successfully in 2 simulations. Prompt 2 was developed through 10 additional test simulations and used successfully in 1 simulation. Conclusions: ChatGPT is capable of creating simulations for early clinical education. These simulations let students practice novel parts of the clinical curriculum, such as forming independent diagnostic and therapeutic impressions over an entire patient encounter. Furthermore, the simulations can adapt to user inputs in a way that replicates real life more accurately than premade question bank clinical vignettes. Finally, ChatGPT can create potentially unlimited free simulations with specific feedback, which increases access for medical students with lower socioeconomic status and underresourced medical schools. However, no tool is perfect, and ChatGPT is no exception; there are concerns about simulation accuracy and replicability that need to be addressed to further optimize ChatGPT’s performance as an educational resource. © Riley Scherr, Faris F Halaseh, Aidin Spina, Saman Andalib, Ronald Rivera.",AI; AI in medical education; artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; clinical education; curriculum; generative; medical education; medical school simulations; preclinical curriculum; simulation; simulations,,"R.

Methods: The display library was derived from a novel approach, in which VHH-based CDR3 regions obtained from a llama (Lama glama), immunized against NKp46, were grafted onto a humanized VHH backbone library that was diversified in CDR1 and CDR2. Following NGS analysis of sequence pools from two rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting we focused on four sequence clusters based on NGS frequency and enrichment analysis as well as in silico developability assessment. For each cluster, long short-term memory (LSTM) based deep generative models were trained and used for the in silico sampling of new sequences. Sequences were subjected to sequence- and structure-based in silico developability assessment to select a set of less than 10 sequences per cluster for production. Results: As demonstrated by binding kinetics and early developability assessment, this procedure represents a general strategy for the rapid and efficient design of potent and automatically humanized sdAb hits from screening selections with favorable early developability profiles.

The scarcity of realistic datasets within the cybersecurity field constitutes a considerable challenge to the development of industry-grade tools intended for real-world application scenarios. Specifically, current datasets are either significantly outdated or fall short on both qualitative and quantitative fronts, primarily because many organizations exhibit reluctance in data sharing, stemming from privacy concerns or the potential threat to trade secrets. To address this challenge, the paper introduces PAC-GPT, a novel framework to generate reliable synthetic data for machine learning methods based on Open AI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3). The core components of this framework are two modules, namely a Flow Generator, which is responsible for capturing and regenerating patterns in a series of network packets, and Packet Generator, which can generate individual network packets given the network flow. We also propose a packet generator based on LLM chaining and then proceed to assess, compare, and evaluate its performance using metrics such as loss, accuracy and success rate, concluding that transformers are a suitable approach for synthetic packet generation with minimal fine-tuning performed. Lastly, a streamlined command line interface (CLI) tool has been devised to facilitate the seamless access of this innovative data generation strategy by professionals from various disciplines. © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; cybersecurity; generative pre-trained transformer; GPT-3; LLMs; machine learning; NLP; transformer,Cybersecurity; Job analysis; Learning systems; Cyber security; Generative pre-trained transformer; Generative pre-trained transformer 3; Generator; LLM; Machine-learning; Task analysis; Telecommunications traffic; Transformer; Artificial intelligence,"P.

Traditional materials engineering education has often relied on a transmission teaching approach, in which students are expected to passively receive information from instructors. However, this approach has shown to be inadequate under the current circumstances, in which information is readily available and innovative tools such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality environments are becoming widespread (e.g., metaverse). Instead, we consider that a critical goal of education should be to develop aptitudes and abilities that enable students to generate solutions and products that address societal demands. In this work, we propose innovative strategies, such as product-based learning methods and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) artificial intelligence text generation models, to modify the focus of a Materials in Chemical Engineering course from non-sustainable materials to sustainable ones, aiming to address the critical challenges of our society. This approach aims to achieve two objectives: first to enable students to actively engage with raw materials and solve real-world challenges, and second, to foster creativity and entrepreneurship skills by providing them with the necessary tools to conduct brainstorming sessions and develop procedures following scientific methods. The incorporation of circular bioeconomy concepts, such as renewable resources, waste reduction, and resource efficiency into the curriculum provides a framework for students to understand the environmental, social, and economic implications in Chemical Engineering. It also allows them to make informed decisions within the circular bioeconomy framework, benefiting society by promoting the development and adoption of sustainable technologies and practices. © 2023 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Artificial intelligence; Biobased; ChatGPT; Chemical engineering; Engineering education; Formulation; Generative AI; Materials,Artificial intelligence; Education computing; Learning systems; Students; Sustainable development; Virtual reality; Bio-based; Bio-based materials; ChatGPT; Chemical engineering education; Formulation; Generative AI; Learning strategy; Material engineering; Teaching approaches; Traditional materials; Engineering education,"R.

AI chatbots, such as GPT-4, developed by OpenAI, have demonstrated potential in supporting health care professionals by providing medical information, answering examination questions, and assisting in medical education. However, the applicability of GPT-4 in the field of pharmacy remains unexplored. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate GPT-4’s ability to answer questions from the Japanese National Examination for Pharmacists (JNEP) and assess its potential as a support tool for pharmacists in their daily practice. Methods: The question texts and answer choices from the 107th and 108th JNEP, held in February 2022 and February 2023, were input into GPT-4. As GPT-4 cannot process diagrams, questions that included diagram interpretation were not analyzed and were initially given a score of 0. The correct answer rates were calculated and compared with the passing criteria of each examination to evaluate GPT-4’s performance. Results: For the 107th and 108th JNEP, GPT-4 achieved an accuracy rate of 64.5% (222/344) and 62.9% (217/345), respectively, for all questions. When considering only the questions that GPT-4 could answer, the accuracy rates increased to 78.2% (222/284) and 75.3% (217/287), respectively. The accuracy rates tended to be lower for physics, chemistry, and calculation questions. Conclusions: Although GPT-4 demonstrated the potential to answer questions from the JNEP and support pharmacists’ capabilities, it also showed limitations in handling highly specialized questions, calculation questions, and questions requiring diagram recognition. Further evaluation is necessary to explore its applicability in real-world clinical settings, considering the complexities of patient scenarios and collaboration with health care professionals. By addressing these limitations, GPT-4 could become a more reliable tool for pharmacists in their daily practice. ©Yuki Kunitsu.",AI; artificial intelligence; chatbot; ChatGPT; generative pretrained transformer; GPT-4; natural language processing; pharmacist; pharmacy,,"Y.

(2) What are some ways educators could utilise ChatGPT in their science pedagogy? and (3) How has ChatGPT been utilised in this study, and what are my reflections about its use as a research tool? This exploratory research applies a self-study methodology to investigate the technology. Impressively, ChatGPT’s output often aligned with key themes in the research. However, as it currently stands, ChatGPT runs the risk of positioning itself as the ultimate epistemic authority, where a single truth is assumed without a proper grounding in evidence or presented with sufficient qualifications. Key ethical concerns associated with AI include its potential environmental impact, issues related to content moderation, and the risk of copyright infringement. It is important for educators to model responsible use of ChatGPT, prioritise critical thinking, and be clear about expectations. ChatGPT is likely to be a useful tool for educators designing science units, rubrics, and quizzes. Educators should critically evaluate any AI-generated resource and adapt it to their specific teaching contexts.

This commentary article delves into the relationship between students and AI, aiming to highlight the need for revised pedagogical strategies in the AI age. We argue that the much-discussed approaches that prioritise AI literacy or augmented critical thinking might be inadequate. Instead, we contend that a more holistic approach emphasising self-regulated learning (SRL) and co-regulation of learning is needed. SRL promotes autonomy, adaptability, and a deeper understanding, qualities indispensable for navigating the intricacies of AI-enhanced learning environments. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of a network of co-regulation, which underscores the intertwined learning processes between humans and machines. By positioning the self at the core of this network, we emphasise the indispensable role of individual agency in steering productive human-AI educational interactions. Our contention is that by fostering SRL and understanding co-regulated dynamics, educators can better equip learners for an interconnected AI-driven world. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

Learning Analytics (LA) can play an important role in the understanding and optimization of responsible and reflective uses of AI tools in education. This paper contributes to the exploration of this role, adopting a human-centered perspective. The paper studies the perspectives of professors and students participating in a 'generative AI for learning' training at a public university in Spain. Considering these perspectives, the paper discusses new requirements for learning analytics in these new learning scenarios using AI. The perspectives highlight the potential of these tools as learning assistants, enabling improved use of study time, stimulating creativity, and facilitating personalized feedback. Stakeholders also points out several ethical concerns and risks that may hinder learning. These preliminary results emphasize the need for LA to differentiate between AI-Assisted and AI-complement actions and human intelligence at work, aligned with pedagogical intentions. The paper formulates high-level constructs for learning analytics differentiating those actions, illustrated with examples. The paper also discusses that ethical concerns, like student inequality in accessing advanced tools, should be factored into analytics and decision-making tools. © 2023 CEUR-WS.

Such tools, however, provide little scope for deeper understanding of AI systems, while the growing public interest in them can eclipse notice of the vibrant community of artists who have long worked with other forms of AI. We explore the potential for AI Art - particularly work in which AI is both tool and topic - to facilitate public AI literacies and consider how tactics developed before the current generative AI boom have continued relevance today. We look at the strategies of critical AI artists to scaffold public understanding of AI and enhance legibility for non-experts. This paper also investigates how collaborations between artists and AI researchers and designers can illuminate key technical and social issues relevant to the development of AI. The study entailed workshops between three professional artists who work with AI and a cross-disciplinary set of academic participants. This paper reports on these workshops and presents the intentions and strategies expressed by the artists, as well as insights of relevance to the research community on public AI literacies. We find that critical AI art can link underlying technical systems to structural issues of power and facilitate experiential learning that is situated and embodied, valuing interpretation over explanation. The findings also demonstrate the importance of transdisciplinary conversations around art, ethics and the political economy of AI technologies and how these dialogues may feed into AI design processes. © 2023 ACM.",AI Art; AI literacy; Art; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Art; Creative AI; Culture; Dialogue; Education; Interdisciplinary Research; Society; Transparency,Ethical technology; AI art; AI literacy; Art; Computational art; Creative AI; Creatives; Culture; Dialog; Interdisciplinary research; Society; Scaffolds,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,978-145037252-7,,,English,ACM Int.

Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the “how”), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the “ideas”), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the “what”), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the “so what”). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a ‘friend’ yet a ‘foe’, (Paradox #2) Generative AI is ‘capable’ yet ‘dependent’, (Paradox #3) Generative AI is ‘accessible’ yet ‘restrictive’, and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even ‘popular’ when ‘banned’ (i.e., the “what”). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarök that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the “so what”). © 2023 The Authors",Academic integrity; Bard; ChatGPT; Critical analysis; DALL-E; Education; Educator; Ethics; Future of education; Generative AI; Generative artificial intelligence; Google; Management education; Management educator; OpenAI; Paradox; Paradox theory; Ragnarök; Reformation; Transformation; Transformative education,,"W.M.

A recent advancement in text-to-image generative AI is GLIDE (Guided Language to Image Diffusion for Generation and Editing). There are a number of representations available in the GLIDE model, but it has not been refined for medical applications. Methods: For text-conditional image synthesis with classifier-free guidance, we have fine-tuned GLIDE using 10,015 dermoscopic images of seven diagnostic entities, including melanoma and melanocytic nevi. Photorealistic synthetic samples of each diagnostic entity were created by the algorithm. Following this, an experienced dermatologist reviewed 140 images (20 of each entity), with 10 samples originating from artificial intelligence and 10 from original images from the dataset. The dermatologist classified the provided images according to the seven diagnostic entities. Additionally, the dermatologist was asked to indicate whether or not a particular image was created by AI. Further, we trained a deep learning model to compare the diagnostic results of dermatologist versus machine for entity classification. Results: The results indicate that the generated images possess varying degrees of quality and realism, with melanocytic nevi and melanoma having higher similarity to real images than other classes. The integration of synthetic images improved the classification performance of the model, resulting in higher accuracy and precision. The AI assessment showed superior classification performance compared to dermatologist. Conclusion: Overall, the results highlight the potential of synthetic images for training and improving AI models in dermatology to overcome data scarcity.

In this conception, learners continually converse with AI language models and other human learners within a dynamic computational medium of internet tools and resources. Learning happens when this distributed human-AI system sets goals, builds meaning from data, consolidates understanding, reconciles differences, and transfers knowledge to new domains. Building social generative AI for education will require development of powerful AI systems that can converse with each other as well as humans, construct external representations such as knowledge maps, access and contribute to internet resources, and act as teachers, learners, guides and mentors. This raises fundamental problems of ethics. Such systems should be aware of their limitations, their responsibility to learners and the integrity of the internet, and their respect for human teachers and experts.

This study aims at exploring the positive and negative aspects of the use of ChatGPT by researchers and students. This paper recommends some practical academic steps and suggestions that help the researchers and publishers curtail the percentage of spread of unethical works such as plagiarism. Design/methodology/approach: The emergence of OpenAI’s Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) has recently sparked controversy and heated debate among academics worldwide about its use and application. The concern of experts and researchers about the GPT-3 platform entails how it would be of much support to the researchers and academic staff and how it might be used and misused to negatively affect academic and scholarly works. This research explored future fears and reassurances about the nature of Chat GPT-3 use at academic and scientific levels. The data for this research was obtained through the qualitative interviews of seven experts in AI, scientific research and academic works. The findings of the study showed that ChatGPT-3 has significant potential and is helpful if used wisely and ethically at scientific and academic levels. On the other hand, the results reported the experts' fears of the frequent use of ChatGPT including the misuse of ChatGPT as a tool to plagiarize and make the researchers dependent, not self-reliant and lazy. The widespread concern of many scholars is that ChatGPT would lead to an increase in the possibility of plagiarism and provide less control over research and writing ethics. This study proposed some stages and suggested that AI language model programs, including ChatGPT, should be integrated with widespread publishers and academic platforms to curtail the percentage of plagiarism and organize the process of publishing and writing scientific research and academic works to save the rights of researchers and writers. Findings: The findings of the research presented that ChatGPT can act as a potential and useful tool if used wisely and ethically at scientific and academic fields. On contrast, the results also reported the negative aspects of the extensive ChatGPT's that leads to the spread of plagiarism and making the researchers and the students machine-dependent, not self-reliant and lazy. This study proposed some stages and suggested that AI language model programs, including ChatGPT, should be integrated with widespread publishers and academic platforms to curtail the percentage of plagiarism and organize the process of publishing and writing scientific research and academic works to save rights of researchers and writers. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to highlight the relationship between using ChatGPT and the spread of both positive and negative aspects of its extensive use in scientific research and academic work. The importance of this study lies in the fact that it presents the concerns and future fears of people in academia as they cope with and deal with the inevitable reality of AI language models such as ChatGPT. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Academic work; AI language model programs; Artificial intelligence (AI); ChatGPT; Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3); Scientific research,,"F.

A specific subset, generative artificial intelligence, has seen significant growth, particularly in late 2022. Tools like ChatGPT, Dall-E, or Midjourney have democratized access to Large Language Models, enabling the creation of human-like content. However, the concept 'Generative Artificial Intelligence' lacks a universally accepted definition, leading to potential misunderstandings. While a model that produces any output can be technically seen as generative, the Artificial Intelligent research community often reserves the term for complex models that generate high-quality, human-like material. This paper presents a literature mapping of AI-driven content generation, analyzing 631 solutions published over the last five years to better understand and characterize the Generative Artificial Intelligence landscape. Our findings suggest a dichotomy in the understanding and application of the term ""Generative AI"". While the broader public often interprets ""Generative AI"" as AI-driven creation of tangible content, the AI research community mainly discusses generative implementations with an emphasis on the models in use, without explicitly categorizing their work under the term ""Generative AI"". © 2023, Universidad Internacional de la Rioja.

Unlike other chatbots, it can create impressive prose within seconds, and it has created much hype and doomsday predictions when it comes to student assessment in higher education and a host of other matters. ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model (a variant of OpenAI’s Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) language model) designed to generate text that can be indistinguishable from text written by humans. It can engage in conversation with users in a seemingly natural and intuitive way. In this article, we briefly tell the story of OpenAI, the organisation behind ChatGPT. We highlight the fundamental change from a not-for-profit organisation to a commercial business model. In terms of our methods, we conducted an extensive literature review and experimented with this artificial intelligence (AI) software. Our literature review shows our review to be amongst the first peer-reviewed academic journal articles to explore ChatGPT and its relevance for higher education (especially assessment, learning and teaching). After a description of ChatGPT’s functionality and a summary of its strengths and limitations, we focus on the technology’s implications for higher education and discuss what is the future of learning, teaching and assessment in higher education in the context of AI chatbots such as ChatGPT. We position ChatGPT in the context of current Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIEd) research, discuss student-facing, teacher-facing and system-facing applications, and analyse opportunities and threats. We conclude the article with recommendations for students, teachers and higher education institutions. Many of them focus on assessment. © 2023.

The available pharmacometric methods have limited capacity for modeling the inter-relationships and patterns of variability among physiological determinants of drug dosing (PDODD). To investigate whether generative adversarial networks (GANs) can learn a generative model from real-world data that recapitulates PDODD distributions. A GAN architecture was developed for modeling a PDODD panel comprised of: age, sex, race/ethnicity, body weight, body surface area, total body fat, lean body weight, albumin concentration, glomerular filtration rate (EGFR), urine flow rate, urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio, alanine aminotransferase to alkaline phosphatase R-value, total bilirubin, active hepatitis B infection status, active hepatitis C infection status, red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet counts. The panel variables were derived from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data sets. The dependence of GAN-generated PDODD on age, race, and active hepatitis infections was assessed. The continuous PDODD biomarkers had diverse non-normal univariate distributions and bivariate trend patterns. The univariate distributions of PDODD biomarkers from GAN simulations satisfactorily approximated those in test data. The joint distribution of the continuous variables was visualized using three 2-dimensional projection methods; for all three methods, the points from the GAN simulation random variate vectors were well dispersed amongst the test data. The age dependence trend patterns in GAN data were similar to those in test data. The histograms for R-values and EGFR from GAN simulations overlapped extensively with test data histograms for the Hispanic, White, African American, and Other race/ethnicity groups. The GAN-simulated data also mirrored the R-values and EGFR changes in active hepatitis C and hepatitis B infection. GANs are a promising approach for simulating the age, race/ethnicity and disease state dependencies of PDODD. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",AI; Artificial intelligence; Generative adversarial networks; Pharmacometrics,Albumins; Biomarkers; Body Weight; ErbB Receptors; Ethnicity; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Humans; Nutrition Surveys; alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alkaline phosphatase; bilirubin; creatinine; epidermal growth factor receptor; hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; albuminoid; biological marker; epidermal growth factor receptor; African American; age; albumin to creatinine ratio; Article; artificial intelligence; body surface; body weight; Caucasian; clinical assessment; concentration process; controlled study; deep learning; drug dose; erythrocyte count; estimated glomerular filtration rate; ethnic group; ethnicity; female; generative adversarial network; glomerulus filtration rate; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; Hispanic; human; lean body weight; leukocyte count; male; pharmacokinetic parameters; physical chemistry; physiological determinant of drug dosing; platelet count; race; total body fat; urine flow rate; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; nutrition,"M.

However, the false positive/negative detection of generative AI has been noted as a challenge. In this article, statistical experiments are conducted to test the chances of false positive and false negative detection of AI-generated text. It was found that the detected likelihoods of generative AI in articles’ abstracts is much lower than that found in paragraphs taken from the literature section of the selected articles. This means that literature parts have higher likelihoods to falsely demonstrate AI-generated text. On the other hand, when genuine texts are compared with AI-generated texts, it is observed that there is a noticeable margin of overlap between their distributions and therefore type I and type II errors fall within the realm of possibility. We show that despite these challenges, generative AI like ChatGPT continues to be a promising tool for communication and information retrieval.

Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have aided diagnoses; however, their performance is often limited due to data imbalance. The aim of this study was to augment imbalanced medical data using generative adversarial networks (GANs) and evaluate the clinical quality of the generated images via a multi-center visual Turing test. Methods Using six chest radiograph datasets, (MIMIC, CheXPert, CXR8, JSRT, VBD, and OpenI), starGAN v2 generated chest radiographs with specific pathologies. Five board-certified radiologists from three university hospitals, each with at least five years of clinical experience, evaluated the image quality through a visual Turing test. Further evaluations were performed to investigate whether GAN augmentation enhanced the convolutional neural network (CNN) classifier performances. Results In terms of identifying GAN images as artificial, there was no significant difference in the sensitivity between radiologists and random guessing (result of radiologists: 147/275 (53.5%) vs result of random guessing: 137.5/275, (50%); p = .284). GAN augmentation enhanced CNN classifier performance by 11.7%. Conclusion Radiologists effectively classified chest pathologies with synthesized radiographs, suggesting that the images contained adequate clinical information. Furthermore, GAN augmentation enhanced CNN performance, providing a bypass to overcome data imbalance in medical AI training. CNN based methods rely on the amount and quality of training data; the present study showed that GAN augmentation could effectively augment training data for medical AI. © 2023 Myong et al.

For successfully learning DSR, it is important to learn to apply it to real-world problems. However, students not only need to learn the new DSR paradigm (meta-level) but also need to develop an understanding of the problem domain (content-level). In this paper, we focus on content-level support (CLS), proposing an illustrative tool to aid students when learning to develop a conceptual design with DSR (e.g., for a prototype). Following the DSR paradigm, we deductively identify students’ issues and use the scaffolding approach to develop design requirements (DRs) and design principles (DPs). To offer AI-generated scaffolding, we use the generative language model (GLM) “GPT-3.” We evaluate our illustrative design through 13 expert interviews. Our results show that providing students with CLS is perceived to be helpful, but the interaction with the student needs to be designed carefully to circumvent unintended usage patterns. We contribute DPs and an illustrative instantiation thereof toward a DSR tool support ecosystem. More broadly, we contribute to the understanding of how humans can be supported by AI to solve problems, an important challenge in human-AI collaboration research. © 2023 by the Information Systems & Computing Academic Professionals, Inc.

Detection of this rare condition is prone to low levels of expert agreement due to the difficulty of identifying subtle rejection signs within biopsy samples. The rarity of pediatric heart transplant rejection also means that very few gold-standard images are available for developing machine learning models. To solve this urgent clinical challenge, we developed a deep learning model to automatically quantify rejection risk within digital images of biopsied tissue using an explainable synthetic data augmentation approach. We developed this explainable AI framework to illustrate how our progressive and inspirational generative adversarial network models distinguish between normal tissue images and those containing cellular rejection signs. To quantify biopsy-level rejection risk, we first detect local rejection features using a binary image classifier trained with expert-annotated and synthetic examples. We converted these local predictions into a biopsy-wide rejection score via an interpretable histogram-based approach. Our model significantly improves upon prior works with the same dataset with an area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 98.84% for the local rejection detection task and 95.56% for the biopsy-rejection prediction task. A biopsy-level sensitivity of 83.33% makes our approach suitable for early screening of biopsies to prioritize expert analysis. Our framework provides a solution to rare medical imaging challenges currently limited by small datasets. © 2023 The Authors",Cardiac pathology; Explainable artificial intelligence; Image classification; Image generation; Multiple instance learning; Whole-slide imaging,Child; Diagnostic Imaging; Heart Failure; Heart Transplantation; Humans; Machine Learning; Postoperative Complications; Risk Assessment; Binary images; Biopsy; Generative adversarial networks; Heart; Image classification; Image enhancement; Learning systems; Medical imaging; Pediatrics; Risk assessment; Tissue; Cardiac pathologies; Explainable artificial intelligence; Heart transplant; Image generations; Images classification; Multiple-instance learning; Risks assessments; Synthetic image generation; Transplant rejection; Whole-slide imaging; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; cardiac graft rejection; child; classification; classifier; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; generative adversarial network; heart muscle biopsy; heart transplantation; human; human tissue; image analysis; image classification; image generation; pediatric surgery; prediction; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; diagnostic imaging; heart failure; machine learning; postoperative complication; risk assessment; Deep learning,"M.D. Wang; Wallace H.

This paper discusses a method and necessary strategies to confront this challenge. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a language model was defined to achieve high accuracy in distinguishing ChatGPT-generated essays from human written essays with a particular focus on “not falsely” classifying genuinely human-written essays as AI-generated (Negative). Findings: Via support vector machine (SVM) algorithm 100% accuracy was recorded for identifying human generated essays. The author discussed the key use of Recall and F2 score for measuring classification performance and the importance of eliminating False Negatives and making sure that no actual human generated essays are incorrectly classified as AI generated. The results of the proposed model's classification algorithms were compared to those of AI-generated text detection software developed by OpenAI, GPTZero and Copyleaks. Practical implications: AI-generated essays submitted by students can be detected by teachers and educational designers using the proposed language model and machine learning (ML) classifier at a high accuracy. Human (student)-generated essays can and must be correctly identified with 100% accuracy even if the overall classification accuracy performance is slightly reduced. Originality/value: This is the first and only study that used an n-gram bag-of-words (BOWs) discrepancy language model as input for a classifier to make such prediction and compared the classification results of other AI-generated text detection software in an empirical way. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",AI generated Text detection; ChatGPT; F2 score; Machine learning; OpenAI; Recall,,"I.

Artificial intelligence (AI) based fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) models are promising techniques. In order to automatically extract the faults features from the raw electrical data of PV array and create efficient FDD model with small dataset, a FDD scheme using Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed. The proposed FDD model is consisting of three modules, a discriminator, a generator and a classifier for fault diagnosis. By analyzing sequential PV data in a 2-Dimension way, the proposed discriminator and generator learn the distribution of PV data under various PV system operations. Then they are utilized to generate more labeled samples to improve the performance of the CNN based classifier. Thus, the proposed FDD model can be trained only requiring minor labeled samples. A laboratory grid-connected PV system is established to experimentally investigate the performance of the developed method. The results demonstrate that the designed FDD model can accurately diagnose line-line and open circuit faults. © 2022 International Solar Energy Society",Convolutional Neural Network; Deep Learning; Faults Diagnosis; Generative Adversarial Network; Photovoltaic Array,Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Electric power distribution; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Solar panels; Solar power generation; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Detection models; Diagnosis model; Fault detection and diagnosis; Faults diagnosis; Performance; Photovoltaic arrays; Photovoltaic data; Small data set; array; artificial neural network; data set; operations technology; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; power plant; Generative adversarial networks,"P.

GPT is trained on massive amounts of text data and uses deep learning techniques to learn patterns and relationships within the data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. This position paper proposes using GPT technology to generate new process models when/if needed. We introduce ProcessGPT as a new technology that has the potential to enhance decision-making in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be designed by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process data. This model can then be fine-tuned on specific process domains and trained to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. The model can be integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. These results underscore the promise of ProcessGPT as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workflows. © 2023 IEEE.",Business Process Management; Data-Centric Processes; Generative AI; Generative Pre-trained Transformer; Knowledge-Intensive Processes,Decision making; Deep learning; Efficiency; Enterprise resource management; Knowledge management; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Business Process; Business process management; Data centric; Data-centric process; Generative AI; Generative pre-trained transformer; Knowledge intensive process; Language processing; Natural languages; Process management; Large dataset,"A.

Amid the rapid growth and maturing of Generative AI technologies such as Large Language Models (like ChatGPT by OpenAI) a rapid growth of both immediate and potential applications can be seen. The implications for the economy and industries of this technological shift will be discussed. The foreseeable scenarios for the level and types of adoption that GAI might achieve - from useful analytical tool, invaluable assistant to the white-collar workers of the world to being trusted with a wide array of business and life-critical decision making. Both disruptive and premium service opportunities are foreseen. For instance, general purpose models may provide quality service - such as copywriting - to overserved customers leaving human writers as the premium option. In this context, overserved customers would be those who would be satisfied with a non-human, potentially less creative content. On the other hand highly specialized models - specifically trained in a given domain and with access to proprietary knowledge can possibly provide a premium service over that provided by human experts. It is expected that some jobs will be replaced by new AI applications. However, new workplaces will emerge. Not only the obvious expert-level data scientist roles but also low grade, ""model supervisors""- people training the models, assessing the quality of responses given and handling escalations. Lastly new cybercrime risks emerging from the rise of GAI are discussed.  © 2023 Tim Orchard et al., published by Sciendo.",artificial intelligence (AI); business models; disruptive technology; Generative AI; Large Language Models (LLM),,"L.

As a result, numerous deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), are being used for detection. DeepFakes detection and removal have become essential challenges. Facebook AI's Deepfake Detection Challenge (DFDC) dataset is invaluable for developing and evaluating detection techniques. While it represents serious risks, creating trustworthy detection techniques might lessen their impact and enable investigation of their possible beneficial applications. To ensure the authenticity and dependability of multimedia information in the face of the ongoing DeepFake threat, this paper emphasizes the importance of transfer learning, deep learning, and optimization techniques in building effective detection models.

The recent release of ChatGPT, a chatbot powered by GPT-3.5 capable of producing accurate and human-like responses to questions in real-time, has redefined the boundaries of academic and scientific writing. These boundaries require objective evaluation. Method: ChatGPT was tested against six subjects across the first three years of the medical radiation science undergraduate course for both exams (n = 6) and written assignment tasks (n = 3). ChatGPT submissions were marked against standardised rubrics and results compared to student cohorts. Submissions were also evaluated by Turnitin for similarity and AI scores. Results: ChatGPT powered by GPT-3.5 performed below the average student performance in all written tasks with an increasing disparity as subjects advanced. ChatGPT performed better than the average student in foundation or general subject examinations where shallow responses meet learning outcomes. For discipline specific subjects, ChatGPT lacked the depth, breadth, and currency of insight to provide pass level answers. Conclusion: ChatGPT simultaneously poses a risk to academic integrity in writing and assessment while affording a tool for enhanced learning environments. These risks and benefits are likely to be restricted to learning outcomes of lower taxonomies. Both risks and benefits are likely to be constrained by higher order taxonomies. Implications for practice: ChatGPT powered by GPT3.5 has limited capacity to support student cheating, introduces errors and fabricated information, and is readily identified by software as AI generated. Lack of depth of insight and appropriateness for professional communication also limits capacity as a learning enhancement tool. © 2023 The College of Radiographers",Academic integrity; Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Generative algorithms; Higher education; Language model,Artificial Intelligence; Diagnostic Imaging; Humans; Learning; Radiography; Software; adult; algorithm; article; artificial intelligence; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; female; human; human experiment; language; learning; learning environment; male; ordo; outcome assessment; risk assessment; software; taxonomy; tertiary education; writing; radiography,"G.

ChatGPT is a newer form of AI-based large language model that can generate complex texts that are almost indistinguishable from human-generated text. It has already garnered substantial interest from people due to its potential utility in a variety of contexts. The current study was conducted to evaluate the utility of ChatGPT in generating accurate, clear, concise, and unbiased information that could support a scientific research process. To achieve this purpose, we initiated queries on both versions of ChatGPT regarding digital school leadership and teachers’ technology integration, two significant topics currently discussed in educational literature, under four categories: (1) the definition of digital leadership, (2) the digital leadership skills of school principals, (3) the factors affecting teachers’ technology integration, and (4) the impact of digital leadership on teachers’ technology integration. Next, we performed a comparative analysis of the responses generated by ChatGPT-3.5 and ChatGPT-4. The results showed that both versions were capable of providing satisfactory information compatible with the relevant literature. However, ChatGPT-4 provided more comprehensive and categorical information as compared to ChatGPT-3.5, which produced responses that were more superficial and short-cut. Although the results are promising in aiding the research process with AI-based technologies, we should also caution that, in their current form, these tools are still in their infancy, and there is a long way to go before they become fully capable of supporting scientific work. Meanwhile, it is significant that researchers continue to develop the relevant knowledge base to support the responsible, safe, and ethical integration of these technologies into the process of scientific knowledge creation, as Pandora’s box has already been opened, releasing newer opportunities and risks to be tackled. © 2023 by the authors.",AI in education; artificial intelligence; chatbot; ChatGPT; digital leadership; generative AI; school leadership; technology integration,,"R.

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art chatbot capable of creating natural conversations using NLP. The use of AI in medicine can have a tremendous impact on health care delivery. Although some studies have evaluated ChatGPT’s accuracy in self-diagnosis, there is no research regarding its precision and the degree to which it recommends medical consultations. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate ChatGPT’s ability to accurately and precisely self-diagnose common orthopedic diseases, as well as the degree of recommendation it provides for medical consultations. Methods: Over a 5-day course, each of the study authors submitted the same questions to ChatGPT. The conditions evaluated were carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), cervical myelopathy (CM), lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), knee osteoarthritis (KOA), and hip osteoarthritis (HOA). Answers were categorized as either correct, partially correct, incorrect, or a differential diagnosis. The percentage of correct answers and reproducibility were calculated. The reproducibility between days and raters were calculated using the Fleiss κ coefficient. Answers that recommended that the patient seek medical attention were recategorized according to the strength of the recommendation as defined by the study. Results: The ratios of correct answers were 25/25, 1/25, 24/25, 16/25, and 17/25 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. The ratios of incorrect answers were 23/25 for CM and 0/25 for all other conditions. The reproducibility between days was 1.0, 0.15, 0.7, 0.6, and 0.6 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. The reproducibility between raters was 1.0, 0.1, 0.64, –0.12, and 0.04 for CTS, CM, LSS, KOA, and HOA, respectively. Among the answers recommending medical attention, the phrases “essential,” “recommended,” “best,” and “important” were used. Specifically, “essential” occurred in 4 out of 125, “recommended” in 12 out of 125, “best” in 6 out of 125, and “important” in 94 out of 125 answers. Additionally, 7 out of the 125 answers did not include a recommendation to seek medical attention. Conclusions: The accuracy and reproducibility of ChatGPT to self-diagnose five common orthopedic conditions were inconsistent. The accuracy could potentially be improved by adding symptoms that could easily identify a specific location. Only a few answers were accompanied by a strong recommendation to seek medical attention according to our study standards. Although ChatGPT could serve as a potential first step in accessing care, we found variability in accurate self-diagnosis. Given the risk of harm with self-diagnosis without medical follow-up, it would be prudent for an NLP to include clear language alerting patients to seek expert medical opinions. We hope to shed further light on the use of AI in a future clinical study. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Simulation results for the LeNet network with 8-bit fixed-point, 16-bit floating-point (FP), and 32-bit FP data paths applied to the MNIST dataset show that over 93% of the pin-level structural faults in a PE are functionally benign. We present a greedy iterative framework for determining the criticality of stuck-at faults in a PE netlist and analyze the limitations of criticality analysis methods based on repeated fault simulations. We next present a scalable two-tier machine-learning (ML)-based method to assess the functional criticality of stuck-at faults in a computationally efficient manner. We address the problem of minimizing misclassification by utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs). Two-tier ML/GAN-based criticality assessment leads to less than 1% test escapes during functional criticality evaluation of structural faults.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence (AI) accelerator; binary classification; catastrophic faults; deep learning; defect screening; functional criticality; generative adversarial network (GAN); greedy fault-dropping; stuck-at faults; systolic array; test escape; two-tier framework,Acceleration; Criticality (nuclear fission); Deep neural networks; Iterative methods; Systolic arrays; Array; Artificial intelligence accelerator; Build in self tests; Builtin self tests (BIST); Circuit faults; Computational modelling; Criticality analysis; Processing elements; Register; Structural faults; Timing circuits,"A.

The emergent discipline of explainable AI (XAI) has made great strides in helping people understand discriminative models. Less attention has been paid to generative models that produce artifacts, rather than decisions, as output. Meanwhile, generative AI (GenAI) technologies are maturing and being applied to application domains such as software engineering. Using scenario-based design and question-driven XAI design approaches, we explore users' explainability needs for GenAI in three software engineering use cases: natural language to code, code translation, and code auto-completion. We conducted 9 workshops with 43 software engineers in which real examples from state-of-the-art generative AI models were used to elicit users' explainability needs. Drawing from prior work, we also propose 4 types of XAI features for GenAI for code and gathered additional design ideas from participants. Our work explores explainability needs for GenAI for code and demonstrates how human-centered approaches can drive the technical development of XAI in novel domains.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",explainable AI; generative AI; human-centered AI; scenario based design; software engineering tooling,Artificial intelligence; AI Technologies; Applications domains; Design approaches; Discriminative models; Explainable AI; Generative AI; Generative model; Human-centered AI; Scenario-based design; Software engineering tooling; Application programs,"J.

It is predicted that the use of GAI applications will increase rapidly in the coming years. Therefore, it is important to consider the challenges and research issues through some concrete application examples of using GAI for education. In this position paper, the authors aim to address these issues from the perspectives of academic research and educational objectives.

In scientific research, AI can enhance the quality and efficiency of data analysis and publication. However, AI has also opened up the possibility of generating high-quality fraudulent papers that are difficult to detect, raising important questions about the integrity of scientific research and the trustworthiness of published papers. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the capabilities of current AI language models in generating high-quality fraudulent medical articles. We hypothesized that modern AI models can create highly convincing fraudulent papers that can easily deceive readers and even experienced researchers. Methods: This proof-of-concept study used ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) powered by the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model to generate a fraudulent scientific article related to neurosurgery. GPT-3 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that uses deep learning algorithms to generate human-like text in response to prompts given by users. The model was trained on a massive corpus of text from the internet and is capable of generating high-quality text in a variety of languages and on various topics. The authors posed questions and prompts to the model and refined them iteratively as the model generated the responses. The goal was to create a completely fabricated article including the abstract, introduction, material and methods, discussion, references, charts, etc. Once the article was generated, it was reviewed for accuracy and coherence by experts in the fields of neurosurgery, psychiatry, and statistics and compared to existing similar articles. Results: The study found that the AI language model can create a highly convincing fraudulent article that resembled a genuine scientific paper in terms of word usage, sentence structure, and overall composition. The AI-generated article included standard sections such as introduction, material and methods, results, and discussion, as well a data sheet. It consisted of 1992 words and 17 citations, and the whole process of article creation took approximately 1 hour without any special training of the human user. However, there were some concerns and specific mistakes identified in the generated article, specifically in the references. Conclusions: The study demonstrates the potential of current AI language models to generate completely fabricated scientific articles. Although the papers look sophisticated and seemingly flawless, expert readers may identify semantic inaccuracies and errors upon closer inspection. We highlight the need for increased vigilance and better detection methods to combat the potential misuse of AI in scientific research. At the same time, it is important to recognize the potential benefits of using AI language models in genuine scientific writing and research, such as manuscript preparation and language editing. © Martin Májovský, Martin Černý, Matěj Kasal, Martin Komarc, David Netuka.

We propose an approach that applies a combination of AI techniques, traditional AI augmented with generative models for automating some of the laborious tasks in contract drafting. With the launches of advanced AI models such as ChatGPT, legal professionals are anticipating how such technologies can streamline their works. We first introduce how these models generate text contents given a user prompt. Then we propose some practical approaches in “prompt writing” which enable better and more coherent contract clauses to be generated. As privacy is typically a great concern in using ChatGPT in professional domains, we also explore the feasibility and effectiveness of using on-premises Large Language Models (LLMs) such as “Vicuna” as practical alternatives that may address the privacy issues while producing acceptable performance in contract drafting. Since AI generated clauses may not match the strict legal requirements or even be incorrect, we propose an approach to evaluate the clauses with traditional AI by using sentence transformers to retrieve similar clauses from a trusted source and perform automatic content similarity analysis. Experimental results using the public dataset LEDGAR showed that LLMs are useful tools for contract clause drafting and the automated comparison results can work as hints or recommendations that users can consider to revise and enhance the generated clauses, hence simplifying the task of contract drafting by legal professionals in an augmented intelligence manner. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

OpenAI's recent release, ChatGPT, uses a transformer-based model to enable human-like text generation and question-answering on general domain knowledge, while a healthcare-specific Large Language Model (LLM) such as GatorTron has focused on the real-world healthcare domain knowledge. As LLMs advance to achieve near human-level performances on medical question and answering benchmarks, it is probable that Conversational AI will soon be developed for use in healthcare. In this article we discuss the potential and compare the performance of two different approaches to generative pretrained transformers—ChatGPT, the most widely used general conversational LLM, and Foresight, a GPT (generative pretrained transformer) based model focused on modelling patients and disorders.

Previous Creative AI curricula mainly focus on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) while paying less attention to Autoregressive Models, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), or other generative models, which have since become common in the field of generative AI. VAEs' latent-space structure and interpolation ability could effectively ground the interdisciplinary learning of AI, creative arts, and philosophy. Thus, we designed a lesson to teach high school students about VAEs. We developed a web-based game and used Plato's cave, a philosophical metaphor, to introduce how VAEs work. We used a Google Colab notebook for students to re-train VAEs with their hand-written digits to consolidate their understandings. Finally, we guided the exploration of creative VAE tools such as SketchRNN and MusicVAE to draw the connection between what they learned and real-world applications.

However, most of the communication between students and educational institutions is still performed physically and causes major administrative overhead, especially during the time of admission. Contemporary pattern-matching-based and generative-based chatbots underperform to queries outside a limited scope, grammatically and structurally ambiguous inputs, outliers to pre-defined rule-set, and longer response times for a huge knowledge base. We proposed a NEdBOT-An NLP-based Educational Bot, developed by Natural Language Processing models integrated within the DialogFlow platform utilizing a Retrieval-based approach. We evaluate the developed chatbot on a custom dataset generated for the admissions use case of a prominent university. We used an objective evaluation criterion with real-world users to achieve an intent classification accuracy of 76.8% at an average mean response time of 216.43ms per query and a user-friendliness score of 72% on the System Usability Scale (SUS). The results demonstrate the proposed approach's ability to create robust, reliable, responsive, and user-friendly web-based smart chatbots that are highly scalable with the capability to handle wider scopes and vague inputs with ease.  © 2022 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; DialogFlow; Educational Chatbot; Natural Language Processing; Retrieval-based approach,Intelligent agents; Knowledge based systems; Pattern matching; Response time (computer systems); Chatbots; Dialogflow; Educational chatbot; Educational institutions; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Pattern-matching; Retrieval-based approach; Rule set; Natural language processing systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166546936-4,,,English,"Proc. - IEEE Int.

However, the image quality of dynamic CT angiography is inferior to standard CT angiography images in many studies. This paper proposes an explainable generative adversarial network named vessel-GAN, which resorts to explainable knowledge-based artificial intelligence to perform image translation with increased trustworthiness. Specifically, we design a loss term to better learn the representations of blood vessels in CT angiography images. The loss term based on expert knowledge guides the generator to focus its training on the important features predicted by the discriminator. Additionally, we propose a generator architecture that effectively fuses spatio-temporal representations and further enhances temporal consistency, thereby improving the quality of the generated CT angiography images. The experiment is conducted on a dataset consisting of 232 patients with suspected coronary artery stenosis. Experimental results show that the PSNR value of vessel-GAN is 28.32 dB, SSIM value is 0.91 and MAE value is 47.36. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed synthesis method, we compare that with other image translation frameworks and GAN-based methods. Compared to other image translation methods, the proposed method vessel-GAN can generate more clearly visible blood vessels from source perfusion images. The CTA images generated by vessel-GAN are closer to the real CTA due to the use of adversarial learning. Compared with other GAN-based methods, vessel-GAN can produce sharper and more homogeneous outputs, including realistic vascular structures. The experiment demonstrates that the explainable generative adversarial network has superior performance for it can better control how models learn. Overall, the CT angiography images generated by vessel-GAN can potentially replace a separate standard CT angiography, allowing the possibility of “one-stop” cardiac examination for high-risk coronary artery disease patients who need assessment of myocardial ischemia. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",Angiography; Explainable AI; Generative adversarial networks; Medical image processing; Myocardial CT perfusion,Angiography; Blood; Computerized tomography; Generative adversarial networks; Heart; Image enhancement; Image reconstruction; Ionizing radiation; Knowledge based systems; Medical image processing; Risk assessment; Angiography images; CT angiography; CT perfusion; Dynamic CT; Explainable AI; Image translation; Learn+; Medical images processing; Myocardial CT perfusion; Perfusion data; Blood vessels,"Z.

Given that knowledge acquisition is a basic determinant of physicians’ performance, teaching and testing different levels of medical knowledge is a central task of medical schools. To measure the factual knowledge level of the ChatGPT responses, we compared the performance of ChatGPT with that of medical students in a progress test. Methods: A total of 400 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from the progress test in German-speaking countries were entered into ChatGPT’s user interface to obtain the percentage of correctly answered questions. We calculated the correlations of the correctness of ChatGPT responses with behavior in terms of response time, word count, and difficulty of a progress test question. Results: Of the 395 responses evaluated, 65.5% of the progress test questions answered by ChatGPT were correct. On average, ChatGPT required 22.8 s (SD 17.5) for a complete response, containing 36.2 (SD 28.1) words. There was no correlation between the time used and word count with the accuracy of the ChatGPT response (correlation coefficient for time rho = −0.08, 95% CI [−0.18, 0.02], t(393) = −1.55, p = 0.121; for word count rho = −0.03, 95% CI [−0.13, 0.07], t(393) = −0.54, p = 0.592). There was a significant correlation between the difficulty index of the MCQs and the accuracy of the ChatGPT response (correlation coefficient for difficulty: rho = 0.16, 95% CI [0.06, 0.25], t(393) = 3.19, p = 0.002). Conclusion: ChatGPT was able to correctly answer two-thirds of all MCQs at the German state licensing exam level in Progress Test Medicine and outperformed almost all medical students in years 1–3. The ChatGPT answers can be compared with the performance of medical students in the second half of their studies. © 2023 The Author(s).

The developments offer great promise for education technology, and in this paper we look specifically at the potential for incorporating large language models in AI-driven language teaching and assessment systems. We consider several research areas - content creation and calibration, assessment and feedback - and also discuss the risks and ethical considerations surrounding generative AI in education technology for language learners. Overall we find that larger language models offer improvements over previous models in text generation, opening up routes toward content generation which had not previously been plausible. For text generation they must be prompted carefully and their outputs may need to be reshaped before they are ready for use. For automated grading and grammatical error correction, tasks whose progress is checked on well-known benchmarks, early investigations indicate that large language models on their own do not improve on state-of-the-art results according to standard evaluation metrics. For grading it appears that linguistic features established in the literature should still be used for best performance, and for error correction it may be that the models can offer alternative feedback styles which are not measured sensitively with existing methods. In all cases, there is work to be done to experiment with the inclusion of large language models in education technology for language learners, in order to properly understand and report on their capacities and limitations, and to ensure that foreseeable risks such as misinformation and harmful bias are mitigated. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

In higher education, it has raised many questions about the authenticity of assessment and challenges in detecting plagiarism. Amongst the resulting frenetic hubbub, hints of potential opportunities in how ChatGPT could support learning and the development of critical thinking have also emerged. In this paper, we examine how ChatGPT may affect assessment in engineering education by exploring ChatGPT responses to existing assessment prompts from ten subjects across seven Australian universities. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of current assessment practice and discuss opportunities on how ChatGPT can be used to facilitate learning. As artificial intelligence is rapidly improving, this analysis sets a benchmark for ChatGPT’s performance as of early 2023 in responding to engineering education assessment prompts. ChatGPT did pass some subjects and excelled with some assessment types. Findings suggest that changes in current practice are needed, as typically with little modification to the input prompts, ChatGPT could generate passable responses to many of the assessments, and it is only going to get better as future versions are trained on larger data sets. © 2023 The Author(s).

This paper compares the lexicographical data provided by ChatGPT and the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary in the scope of microstructure. Two main datasets are created for manual analysis and similarity score tests. The aim is to demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatGPT in providing lexicographical data to English language learners as compared to the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary. We accomplish this by comparing the provided data related to lexicographical items, using Wiegand’s item classes to identify the co-occurring items within the microstructure of both platforms. The framework of item classes provides us with a list of lexicographical items that serve as our criteria. We then examine each lexical entry individually to determine whether each lexicographical item is present in both tools. The results are presented in a comparative table as percentages. Also, using Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU) and Recall Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (ROUGE) methods we calculate the similarity between the lexicographical data provided by ChatGPT and the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary. Since ChatGPT has been trained on human data, we investigate how similar its generated answers are to the ground truth. This study provides valuable insights into the potential of AI-generated dictionary content and its applicability in pedagogical lexicography. Additionally, it highlights the challenges and limitations that need to be addressed in order to inform the development of AI models for lexicography. © 2023 Lexical Computing CZ s.r.o..

Since the teeth of an individual subject are controlled by the same set of genes (genotype) and are exposed to mostly identical oral environment (phenotype), the occlusal morphology and 3D position of teeth of an individual patient are inter-related. It is hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) can automate the design of single-tooth dental prostheses after learning the features of the remaining dentition. Materials and methods This article describes the protocol of a prospective experimental study, which aims to train and to validate the AI system for design of single molar dental prostheses. Maxillary and mandibular dentate teeth models will be collected and digitized from at least 250 volunteers. The (original) digitized maxillary teeth models will be duplicated and processed by removal of right maxillary first molars (FDI tooth 16). Teeth models will be randomly divided into training and validation sets. At least 200 training sets of the original and the processed digitalized teeth models will be input into 3D Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for training. Among the validation sets, tooth 16 will be generated by AI on 50 processed models and the morphology and 3D position of AI-generated tooth will be compared to that of the natural tooth in the original maxillary teeth model. The use of different GAN algorithms and the need of antagonist mandibular teeth model will be investigated. Results will be reported following the CONSORT-AI. © 2022 Chau et al.

The model is designed to address a need to more rapidly develop increased occupational hard and soft skill competencies that increases advantages over near-peer competitors, and with a higher probability of transfer when applied in a real occupational setting. To do this not only are explicit-technology knowledge and skills need to be trained but also implicit-tacit knowledge and skill required by teams and personnel; however, current training methods are incapable of producing both. By saving, reducing, and labeling real occupational contextual mission, task and performance data, as well as after-action event reports, assessments, communications, and testimonies (i.e., experiences), we intend to then use a generative artificial intelligence (AI) model to not only enforce technical ability but essentially transfer experiences, and associated tacit knowledge, from existing occupational experts, to new generations of occupational workers. The generative AI model, along with new occupational experience design tools, and a syntactic, machine-readable form of experiential content design, will be discussed, as they apply to a competency-based experiential learning model, that together with the use of adaptive learning technology, we hope will simplify and enable any instructor/trainer to employ experiential learning in their training curriculum. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Competency; Experience Design; Experiential Learning; Tacit Knowledge,Engineering education; Learning systems; Occupational risks; Personnel training; Competency; Data collection; Experience design; Experiential learning; Intelligence models; Learning models; Tacit knowledge; Training data; U.S. Army; US Army; Artificial intelligence,"K.

Statistical learning, a generalized framework from machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) is predestined for processing ""Big Data""and holds the potential to revolutionize the field of laboratory medicine. Personalized medicine may in particular benefit from AI-based systems, especially when coupled with readily available wearables and smartphones which can collect health data from individual patients and offer new, cost-effective access routes to healthcare for patients worldwide. The amount of personal data collected, however, also raises concerns about patient-privacy and calls for clear ethical guidelines for ""Big Data""research, including rigorous quality checks of data and algorithms to eliminate underlying bias and enable transparency. Likewise, novel federated privacy-preserving data processing approaches may reduce the need for centralized data storage. Generative AI-systems including large language models such as ChatGPT currently enter the stage to reshape clinical research, clinical decision-support systems, and healthcare delivery. In our opinion, AI-based systems have a tremendous potential to transform laboratory medicine, however, their opportunities should be weighed against the risks carefully. Despite all enthusiasm, we advocate for stringent added-value assessments, just as for any new drug or treatment. Human experts should carefully validate AI-based systems, including patient-privacy protection, to ensure quality, transparency, and public acceptance.

However, few existing works have thoroughly explored the potential of AI in code generation and users' attitudes toward AI-assisted coding tools. This knowledge gap leaves it unclear how AI is transforming software engineering and programming education. This paper presents a scalable crowdsourcing data-driven framework to investigate the code generation performance of generative large language models from diverse perspectives across multiple social media platforms. Specifically, we utilize ChatGPT, a popular generative large language model, as a representative example to reveal its insights and patterns in code generation. First, we propose a hybrid keyword word expansion method that integrates words suggested by topic modeling and expert knowledge to filter relevant social posts of interest on Twitter and Reddit. Then we collect 316K tweets and 3.2K Reddit posts about ChatGPT's code generation, spanning from Dec. 1, 2022 to January 31, 2023. Our data analytics show that ChatGPT has been used in more than 10 programming languages, with Python and JavaScript being the two most popular, for a diverse range of tasks such as code debugging, interview preparation, and academic assignment solving. Surprisingly, our analysis shows that fear is the dominant emotion associated with ChatGPT's code generation, overshadowing emotions of happiness, anger, surprise, and sadness. Furthermore, we construct a ChatGPT prompt and corresponding code dataset by analyzing the screen-shots of ChatGPT code generation shared on social media. This dataset enables us to evaluate the quality of the generated code, and we have released this dataset to the public. We believe the insights gained from our work will provide valuable guidance for future research on AI-powered code generation. © 2023 IEEE.",ChatGPT; Coding Generation; Generative Models; Large Language Models (LLMs); Social Media; Software Engineering,Computational linguistics; Data Analytics; High level languages; Program debugging; Quality control; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Software testing; ChatGPT; Codegeneration; Coding generation; Generative model; Language model; Large language model; Performance; Social datum; Social media; User attitudes; Crowdsourcing,"Y.

AI models show good performance for definite tasks such as image classification and text generation. With the recent development of generative models (e.g., BigGAN, GPT-3), AI models also show impressive results for diverse generation tasks (e.g., photo-realistic image, paragraph generation). As the performance of each AI model improves, interest in comprehensive tasks, such as visual language navigation (VLN) which follows the language instruction with an egocentric view, is also growing. However, the model integration for VLN has a problem due to the model complexity, modal heterogeneity, and paired data shortage. This study provides a comprehensive survey on VLN with a systemic approach for reviewing recent trends. At first, we define a taxonomy for fundamental techniques which need to perform VLN. We analyze from four perspectives of VLN: representation learning, reinforcement learning, component, and evaluation. We investigate the pros and cons of each component and methodology that have been conducted recently. This survey categorizes major research institute's approaches with taxonomy defined in four perspectives, unlike other conventional surveys.

It is remarkable how artificial intelligence can mimic human behavior and writing style in such a convincing way. As a result, it is hard to tell if a human or a machine wrote something. Deep learning and natural language processing have recently advanced large language models. These newer models can learn from large amounts of data to better capture the nuances of language, making them more accurate and robust than ever before. Additionally, these models can now be applied to tasks such as summarizing text, translating between languages, and even generating original content. ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed in 2022 by OpenAI for open-ended conversations. It is based on GPT-3.5, the third-generation language processing model from OpenAI. ChatGPT can power conversational AI applications like virtual assistants and chatbots.

Already, there is evidence to suggest that written letters of recommendation contain language that expresses implicit biases, or unconscious biases, and that these biases occur for all recommenders regardless of the recommender’s sex. Given that all individuals have implicit biases that may influence language use, there may be opportunities to apply contemporary technologies, such as large language models or other forms of generative artificial intelligence (AI), to augment and potentially reduce implicit biases in the written language of letters of recommendation. In this editorial, we provide a brief overview of existing literature on the manifestations of implicit bias in letters of recommendation, with a focus on academia and medical education. We then highlight potential opportunities and drawbacks of applying this emerging technology in augmenting the focused, professional task of writing letters of recommendation. We also offer best practices for integrating their use into the routine writing of letters of recommendation and conclude with our outlook for the future of generative AI applications in supporting this task. © 2023 JMIR Medical Education.

Idioms are a part of everyday speech in many languages and across many cultures, but they pose a great challenge for many natural language processing (NLP) systems that involve tasks such as information retrieval (IR), machine translation (MT), and conversational artificial intelligence (AI). We utilized the Potential Idiomatic Expression (PIE)-English idiom corpus for the two tasks that we investigated: classification and conversation generation. We achieved a state-of-the-art (SoTA) result of a 98% macro F1 score on the classification task by using the SoTA T5 model. We experimented with three instances of the SoTA dialogue model—the Dialogue Generative Pre-trained Transformer (DialoGPT)—for conversation generation. Their performances were evaluated by using the automatic metric, perplexity, and a human evaluation. The results showed that the model trained on the idiom corpus generated more fitting responses to prompts containing idioms 71.9% of the time in comparison with a similar model that was not trained on the idiom corpus.

Their success relies on the self-attention mechanism that provides a global rather than local receptive field as CNNs. Despite its superiority, the global-level self-attention consumes ∼ 100× more operations than CNNs and cannot be effectively handled by the existing CNN processor due to the distinct operations. It inspires an urgent requirement to design a dedicated Transformer processor. However, global self-attention involves massive naturally existent weakly related tokens (WR-Tokens) due to the redundant contents in human languages or images. These WR-Tokens generate zero and near-zero attention results that introduce energy consumption bottleneck, redundant computations, and hardware under-utilization issues, making it challenging to achieve energy-efficient self-attention computing. This article proposes a Transformer processor effectively handling the WR-Tokens to solve these challenges. First, a big-exact-small-approximate processing element (PE) reduces multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) energy for WR-Tokens by adaptively computing the small values approximately while computing the large values exactly. Second, a bidirectional asymptotical speculation unit captures and removes redundant computations of zero attention outputs by exploiting the local property of self-attention. Third, an out-of-order PE-line computing scheduler improves hardware utilization for near-zero values by reordering the operands to dovetail two operations into one multiplication. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS technology, the proposed processor occupies an area of 6.82 mm2. When evaluated with a 90% of approximate computing for the generative pre-trained transformer 2 (GPT-2) model, the peak energy efficiency is 27.56 TOPS/W under 0.56 V at 50 MHz, 17.66× higher than A100 graphics processing unit (GPU). Compared with the state-of-the-art Transformer processor, it reduces energy by 4.57× and offers 3.73× speedup.  © 2022 IEEE.",Approximate computing; out-of-order computing; processor; self-attention; speculating; Transformer,Artificial intelligence; Computer hardware; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Green computing; Natural language processing systems; Sports; Approximate computing; Computational modelling; Out of order; Out-of-order computing; Processor; Self-attention; Speculating; Technological innovation; Transformer; Convolution,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,189200,,IJSCB,,English,IEEE J Solid State Circuits,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141457304

Objective: This study aimed to assess the feasibility of using ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) or a similar artificial intelligence-based chatbot for patient-provider communication. Methods: A survey study was conducted in January 2023. Ten representative, nonadministrative patient-provider interactions were extracted from the electronic health record. Patients' questions were entered into ChatGPT with a request for the chatbot to respond using approximately the same word count as the human provider's response. In the survey, each patient question was followed by a provider- or ChatGPT-generated response. Participants were informed that 5 responses were provider generated and 5 were chatbot generated. Participants were asked-and incentivized financially-to correctly identify the response source. Participants were also asked about their trust in chatbots' functions in patient-provider communication, using a Likert scale from 1-5. Results: A US-representative sample of 430 study participants aged 18 and older were recruited on Prolific, a crowdsourcing platform for academic studies. In all, 426 participants filled out the full survey. After removing participants who spent less than 3 minutes on the survey, 392 respondents remained. Overall, 53.3% (209/392) of respondents analyzed were women, and the average age was 47.1 (range 18-91) years. The correct classification of responses ranged between 49% (192/392) to 85.7% (336/392) for different questions. On average, chatbot responses were identified correctly in 65.5% (1284/1960) of the cases, and human provider responses were identified correctly in 65.1% (1276/1960) of the cases. On average, responses toward patients' trust in chatbots' functions were weakly positive (mean Likert score 3.4 out of 5), with lower trust as the health-related complexity of the task in the questions increased. Conclusions: ChatGPT responses to patient questions were weakly distinguishable from provider responses. Laypeople appear to trust the use of chatbots to answer lower-risk health questions. It is important to continue studying patient-chatbot interaction as chatbots move from administrative to more clinical roles in health care. © 2023 The Author(s).",AI; artificial intelligence; Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer; chatbot; ChatGPT; ethics; feasibility; language model; large language model; machine learning; patient-provider interaction; privacy,,"O.

The study conducted experiments on three models - CNN, HiSAN, and BERT - using the Reuters dataset. First, the study evaluated the effectiveness of incorporating ChatGPT-generated samples and then analyzed the impact of various factors such as sample size, sample variability, and sample length on the models' performance by varying the number, variety, and length of the generated samples. The models were assessed using macro and micro-averaged scores, and the results revealed that the macro-averaged scores improved significantly across all three models, with the BERT model showing the greatest improvement (from 49.87% to 65.73% in macro F1 score). The study further found that adding 30 distinct samples produced better results than adding 6 duplicates of 5 samples, and samples with 150 and 256 words had similar performance, while those with 50 words performed slightly worse. These findings suggest that incorporating external knowledge samples generated by a generative AI is an effective approach to enhance text classification models' performance. The study also highlights that the variability of articles generated by ChatGPT positively impacted the models' accuracy, and longer synthesized texts convey more comprehensive information on the subjects, leading to higher classification accuracy scores. Additionally, we conducted a comparison between our results and those obtained from EDA, a widely used data augmentation generator. The findings clearly demonstrate that our method surpasses EDA and offers additional advantages by reducing computational costs and solving zero-shot problem.

This study investigated the effect of programming education using the ChatGPT on students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation toward the lesson. The research was conducted on 45 undergraduate students who took a university-level programming course. The research was carried out according to the experimental design with the pretest-posttest control group. Students were randomly divided into experimental (n = 21) and control (n = 24) groups. While the experimental group students benefited from the ChatGPT during the weekly programming practices, the control group students did not use this tool. Research data were obtained through the computational thinking scale, computer programming self-efficacy scale, and learning motivation in computer programming courses scale. Research findings revealed that the experimental group students' computational thinking skills, programming self-efficacy, and motivation for the lesson were significantly higher than the control group students. In line with this result, it can be said that it may be useful to benefit from AI technologies such as ChatGPT in programming trainings.

One popular approach is using reinforcement learning to update a recurrent neural network or language-based de novo molecule generator. However, reinforcement learning can be inefficient, sometimes requiring up to 105 molecules to be sampled to optimize more complex objectives, which poses a limitation when using computationally expensive scoring functions like docking or computer-aided synthesis planning models. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning strategy called Augmented Hill-Climb based on a simple, hypothesis-driven hybrid between REINVENT and Hill-Climb that improves sample-efficiency by addressing the limitations of both currently used strategies. We compare its ability to optimize several docking tasks with REINVENT and benchmark this strategy against other commonly used reinforcement learning strategies including REINFORCE, REINVENT (version 1 and 2), Hill-Climb and best agent reminder. We find that optimization ability is improved ~ 1.5-fold and sample-efficiency is improved ~ 45-fold compared to REINVENT while still delivering appealing chemistry as output. Diversity filters were used, and their parameters were tuned to overcome observed failure modes that take advantage of certain diversity filter configurations. We find that Augmented Hill-Climb outperforms the other reinforcement learning strategies used on six tasks, especially in the early stages of training or for more difficult objectives. Lastly, we show improved performance not only on recurrent neural networks but also on a reinforcement learning stabilized transformer architecture. Overall, we show that Augmented Hill-Climb improves sample-efficiency for language-based de novo molecule generation conditioning via reinforcement learning, compared to the current state-of-the-art. This makes more computationally expensive scoring functions, such as docking, more accessible on a relevant timescale. © 2022, The Author(s).",AI; Artificial intelligence; De novo design; Deep learning; Generative models; Hill-Climb; Molecular docking; Recurrent neural network; REINFORCE; Reinforcement learning; REINVENT; SBDD; Structure-based drug design,,"M.

Using ChatGPT to support or generate scientific research has also created an ongoing debate over its advantages versus risks. The present study aimed to conduct an AI-enabled research process using ChatGPT so as to evaluate its potential to generate an accurate, clear, concise, and unbiased information as these are essential elements of rigorous scientific work. Materials/methods - To achieve this aim, we worked on emergency remote teaching (ERT), which garnered significant interest due to its wide-spread use during the COVID-19 pandemic, and created opposing views, particularly in comparison to online teaching. We conducted a simultaneous query on ChatGPT-3.5 and 4 on five basic themes: (1) the definition and emergence of ERT, (2) the appropriateness of ERT for different grade levels, (3) a comparison between ERT and online teaching, (4) the possible outcomes of ERT, (5) the future prospects and uses of ERT, and we performed a comparative evaluation of these responses with regard to accuracy, clarity, conciseness, and potential bias. We also used Cohen's kappa to assess inter-rater agreement in our analysis. Results - The results indicated that both versions were capable of generating accurate information without significant bias although the responses lacked depth and insight with being somewhat repetitive. As the level of judgment required by the query increased, the performance of ChatGPT-4 was much better; it provided clearer and more concise responses with a more synthesized and detailed categories of information on ERT. Conclusion - Based on our results, we state that the cooperation of human and artificial intelligence is still warranted to ensure an accurate and reliable output from AI-based scientific queries.

In the following position paper, we explore how human-centered AI (HCAI) can be a useful perspective on AI in the age of generative AI (GAI) for the educational sector. However, we also suggest taking advantage of GAI tools to prepare the next generation of students for a future workplace requiring informed interaction with AI tools. We argue there is a lot of potential for applying AI in education, which can be advantageous for both teachers and students to increase the educational experience. However, there are also major challenges.

One promising development in this field is the use of generative artificial intelligence technology, such as the ChatGPT conversational agent. ChatGPT has the potential to offer personalized and effective learning experiences by providing students with customized feedback and explanations, as well as creating realistic virtual simulations for hands-on learning. However, it is important to also consider the limitations of this technology. ChatGPT and other generative AI systems are only as good as their training data and may perpetuate biases or even generate and spread misinformation. Additionally, the use of generative AI in education raises ethical concerns such as the potential for unethical or dishonest use by students and the potential unemployment of humans who are made redundant by technology. While the current state of generative AI technology represented by ChatGPT is impressive but flawed, it is only a preview of what is to come.

However, this student-led learning can be challenging to achieve in a classroom limited by a one-to-many teacher-led instruction. We, thus, have designed and prototyped a generative artificial intelligence chatbot application (GAIA), named TeacherGAIA, that can be used to asynchronously support students in their self-directed learning and self-assessment outside the classroom. We first identified diverse constructivist learning approaches that align with, and promote, student-led learning. These included knowledge construction, inquiry-based learning, self-assessment, and peer teaching. The in-context learning abilities of large language model (LLM) from OpenAI were then leveraged via prompt engineering to steer interactions supporting these different learning approaches. These interactions contrasted with ChatGPT, OpenAI’s chatbot which by default engaged in the traditional transmissionist mode of learning reminiscent of teacher-led instruction. Preliminary design, prompt engineering and prototyping suggested fidelity to the learning approaches, cognitive guidance, and social-emotional support, all of which were implemented in a generative AI manner without pre-specified rules or “hard-coding”. Other affordances of TeacherGAIA are discussed and future development outlined.

Its ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses across a wide range of topics have also attracted the attention of researchers, and several scholars have investigated the potential uses of this AI-based tool to promote scientific work. The current study was designed with a similar purpose, and aimed to conduct scientific research on the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on education with a collaborative analysis of human-artificial intelligence. Materials/methods – The data were generated from simultaneous interviews with ChatGPT-3.5 and 4, and their responses were evaluated comparatively in terms of the accuracy, clarity, conciseness, and breadth of information provided for (1) the definition of the COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, (3) the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education, (4) recommendations to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. We evaluated the responses using a trichotomous rating system, and also calculated Cohen’s kappa values to assess inter-rater agreements for each category of evaluation. Results – The results indicated that both versions demonstrated a strong potential to generate accurate, clear and concise information with a satisfactory breadth. As can be expected, ChatGPT-4 provided more categorized and synthesized information, and was better at demonstrating critical reasoning. Conclusion – These results indicate that ChatGPT is a promising tool that can support scientific research process in collaboration with human intelligence, and its newer versions could be developed in a way that these chatbots could be ethically and safely integrated into different stages of scientific work.

O bir hemşire” to English, the outcome is biased: “He is a doctor. She is a nurse.” In 2016, we have demonstrated that language representations trained via unsupervised learning automatically embed implicit biases documented in social cognition through the statistical regularities in language corpora. Evaluating embedding associations in language, vision, and multi-modal vision-language models reveals that large-scale sociocultural data is a source of implicit human biases regarding gender, race or ethnicity, skin color, ability, age, sexuality, religion, social class, and intersectional associations. The study of gender bias in language, vision, vision-language, and generative AI has highlighted the sexualization of women and girls in AI, while easily accessible generative AI models such as text-to-image generators amplify bias at scale. As AI increasingly automates tasks that determine life's outcomes and opportunities, the ethics of AI bias has significant implications for human cognition, society, justice, and the future of AI. Thus, it is necessary to advance our understanding of the depth, prevalence, and complexities of bias in AI to mitigate it both in machines and society. © 2023 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

Prior research has concentrated on strengthening interactions through the deployment of social robots, while disregarding the capabilities required to boost the flexibility and user experience associated with human-robot collaboration (HRC) on manufacturing tasks. One of the main challenges is the lack of publicly available industrial-oriented dialogue datasets for the training of conversational AI. In this work, we present an Industrial Robot Wizard-of-Oz Dialoguing Dataset (IRWoZ) focused on enabling HRC in manufacturing tasks. The dataset covers four domains: assembly, transportation, position, and relocation. It is created using the Wizard-of-Oz technique to be less noisy. We manually constructed, annotated and validated dialogue segments (e.g., intentions, slots, annotations), as well as the responses. Building upon the proposed dataset, we benchmark it on the state-of-the-art (SoTA) language models, generative pre-trained (GPT-2) models, on dialogue state tracking and response generation tasks.

Discussions of opportunities (e.g., content generation, explanation) and risks (e.g., cheating) of this emerging technology in education have intensified, but to date there has not been a study of the models' capabilities in supporting the course design and authoring of LOs. LOs articulate the knowledge and skills learners are intended to acquire by engaging with a course. To be effective, LOs must focus on what students are intended to achieve, focus on specific cognitive processes, and be measurable. Thus, authoring high-quality LOs is a challenging and time consuming (i.e., expensive) effort. We evaluated 127 LOs that were automatically generated based on a carefully crafted prompt (detailed guidelines on high-quality LOs authoring) submitted to GPT-4 for conceptual modules and projects of an AI Practitioner course. We analyzed the generated LOs if they follow certain best practices such as beginning with action verbs from Bloom's taxonomy in regards to the level of sophistication intended. Our analysis showed that the generated LOs are sensible, properly expressed (e.g., starting with an action verb), and that they largely operate at the appropriate level of Bloom's taxonomy, respecting the different nature of the conceptual modules (lower levels) and projects (higher levels). Our results can be leveraged by instructors and curricular designers wishing to take advantage of the state-of-the-art generative models to support their curricular and course design efforts. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

However, malware and malicious applications containing unwanted advertisements exist in these application markets. Therefore, smartphone users install applications with reference to the application review to avoid such malicious applications. An application review typically comprises contents for evaluation; however, a false review with a specific purpose can be included. Such false reviews are known as fake reviews, and they can be generated using artificial intelligence (AI)-based text-generating models. Recently, AI-based text-generating models have been developed rapidly and demonstrate high-quality generated texts. Herein, we analyze the features of fake reviews generated from Generative Pre-Training-2 (GPT-2), an AI-based text-generating model and create a model to detect those fake reviews. First, we collect a real human-written application review from Kaggle. Subsequently, we identify features of the fake review using natural language processing and statistical analysis. Next, we generate fake review detection models using five types of machine-learning models trained using identified features. In terms of the performances of the fake review detection models, we achieved average F1-scores of 0.738, 0.723, and 0.730 for the fake review, real review, and overall classifications, respectively. © 2022 KIPS",Artificial intelligence; Fake review; Gpt-2; Language model; Machine learning; Software engineering,Application programs; Commerce; Computational linguistics; Fake detection; Feature extraction; Learning systems; Malware; Mobile computing; Natural language processing systems; Detection models; Fake review; Fake review detections; Feature analysis; Generating models; Gpt-2; Language model; Machine-learning; Malwares; Mobile applications; Learning algorithms,"Y.-S.

A trend is emerging for the development of new machine-learning techniques applied to the automatic process of CPET data. Some of these focus on the precise task of detecting the exercise thresholds, which represent important physiological parameters. Three are the major challenges tackled by this contribution: (A) regression (i.e., the process of correctly identifying the exercise intensity domains and their crossing points); (B) generation (i.e., the process of artificially creating a CPET data file ex-novo); and (C) explanation (i.e., proving an interpretable explanation about the output of the machine learning model). The following methods were used for each challenge: (A) a convolutional neural network adapted for multi-variable time series; (B) a conditional generative adversarial neural network; and (C) visual explanations and calculations of model decisions have been conducted using cooperative game theory (Shapley’s values). The results for the regression, generation, and explanatory techniques for AI-assisted CPET interpretation are presented here in a unique framework for the first time: (A) machine learning techniques reported an expert-level accuracy in the classification of exercise intensity domains; (B) experts are not able to substantially differentiate between a real vs an artificially generated CPET; and (C) Shapley’s values can provide an explanation about the choices of the algorithms in terms of ventilatory variables. With the aim to increase their technology-readiness level, all the models discussed in this contribution have been incorporated into a free-to-use Python package called pyoxynet (ver. 12.1). This contribution should therefore be of interest to major players operating in the CPET device market and engineering. © 2023 by the author.",artificial intelligence; cardiopulmonary stress test; deep learning; explainable AI; machine learning; machine learning interpretability,"Algorithms; Exercise Test; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Physiological models; Python; Regression analysis; Cardiopulmonary stress test; Deep learning; Exercise test; Explainable AI; Interpretability; Machine learning interpretability; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Stress test; algorithm; exercise test; machine learning; procedures; Game theory","A.

The rapid emergence of ChatGPT and similar AI tools, such as Google’s Bard, and GPT-enabled Bing from Microsoft have led to intense discussions about how they will affect various aspects of society, including higher education. Information systems (IS) education will not escape the impact of AI tools. Our goal for this paper is to develop a better understanding of the range of possible impacts of ChatGPT on IS education and to describe how IS educators might respond to these potential impacts. To that end, we discuss challenges for IS education brought on by generative AI tools, discuss potential future scenarios based on the emergence of such tools, ranging from AI having little impact on IS education to AI serving as competition for IS educators. We examine the challenges and consequences of each scenario. We also discuss potential responses, ranging from doing nothing to embracing AI tools as legitimate learning aids. We then provide several specific recommendations that will allow IS educators to effectively respond to the rise of AI tools. © 2023, Association for Information Systems.

We aimed to develop an AI that can be independently applied to recover high-quality imaging from low-dose scans on different scanners and tracers. Methods: Brain [18F]FDG PET imaging of 237 patients scanned with one scanner was used for the development of AI technology. The developed algorithm was then tested on [18F]FDG PET images of 45 patients scanned with three different scanners, [18F]FET PET images of 18 patients scanned with two different scanners, as well as [18F]Florbetapir images of 10 patients. A conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) was customized for cross-scanner and cross-tracer optimization. Three nuclear medicine physicians independently assessed the utility of the results in a clinical setting. Results: The improvement achieved by AI recovery significantly correlated with the baseline image quality indicated by structural similarity index measurement (SSIM) (r = −0.71, p < 0.05) and normalized dose acquisition (r = −0.60, p < 0.05). Our cross-scanner and cross-tracer AI methodology showed utility based on both physical and clinical image assessment (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The deep learning development for extensible application on unknown scanners and tracers may improve the trustworthiness and clinical acceptability of AI-based dose reduction. © 2021, The Author(s).",Cross-scanner; Cross-tracer; Deep learning; Low-dose; PET; Recovery,florbetapir f 18; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adult; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; deep learning; deep neural network; female; human; image quality; major clinical study; male; micro-computed tomography; middle aged; neuroimaging; physician; positron emission tomography; radiation dose; standardized uptake value ratio,"B.

This study proposes a method for combining the transformer deep-learning model with generative adversarial networks (GANs) to explore a more competitive music generation algorithm. The idea of text generation in natural language processing (NLP) was used for reference, and a unique loss function was designed for the model. The training process solves the problem of a nondifferentiable gradient in generating music. Compared with the problem that LSTM cannot deal with long sequence music, the model based on transformer and GANs can extract the relationship in the notes of long sequence music samples and learn the rules of music composition well. At the same time, the optimized transformer and GANs model has obvious advantages in the complexity of the system and the accuracy of generating notes. © 2022 by the authors.",artificial intelligence (AI); GANs; music generation; natural language processing; transformer,,"L.

Notably, many underwater tasks, including the assessment of subsea infrastructure, are performed with the assistance of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). There have been recent breakthroughs in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, notably, Deep Learning (DL) models and applications, which have widespread usage in a variety of fields, including aerial unmanned vehicles, autonomous car navigation, and other applications. However, they are not as prevalent in underwater applications due to the difficulty of obtaining underwater datasets for a specific application. In this sense, the current study utilises recent advancements in the area of DL to construct a bespoke dataset generated from photographs of items captured in a laboratory environment. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were utilised to translate the laboratory object dataset into the underwater domain by combining the collected images with photographs containing the underwater environment. The findings demonstrated the feasibility of creating such a dataset, since the resulting images closely resembled the real underwater environment when compared with real-world underwater ship hull images. Therefore, the artificial datasets of the underwater environment can overcome the difficulties arising from the limited access to real-world underwater images and are used to enhance underwater operations through underwater object image classification and detection. © 2022 by the authors.",autonomous inspection; AUVs; computer vision; deep learning; machine learning; ROVs,,"R.

However, there is a limited study on AI dialogue systems can dynamically generate humorous interactions and empathetic responses to learners' emotions while considering their cultural diversity. This work-in-progress paper presents an interactive adversarial learning system, the MACHE-Bot, based on Wasserstein's generative adversarial network (WGAN) that uses user input to determine whether the generated responses entail humor, empathy, and culture in learning. The significance of the MACHE-Bot is: (1) it can trigger humorous and empathetic interactions and consider learners' cultural varieties, (2) it is able to capture the subtleties of user emotion, (3) it is capable of expressing multimodal humorous responses by recalling prior context and external knowledge, and (4) it is embedded with a corpus of cultural contexts, semantic properties, and language editions to enhance learning experience and outcomes. This study is useful because the ability of the MACHE-Bot to generate responses that are tailored to the user's emotions and cultural background can greatly enhance the learning experience and lead to better learning outcomes. Additionally, the use of a WGAN and the incorporation of external knowledge and cultural context makes the MACHE-Bot a unique and innovative system that has the potential to improve the overall effectiveness of AI-powered educational systems. © 2023 IEEE.",cultural diversity; empathetic responses; humorous interactions; WGAN,Generative adversarial networks; Semantics; Speech processing; Cultural context; Cultural diversity; Dialogue systems; Empathetic response; External knowledge; Humorous interaction; Learning experiences; Learning outcome; User emotions; Wasserstein generative adversarial network; Learning systems,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166546548-9,,,English,"Int.

Methods: This was a cohort study involving two hospitals (A and B). We developed the AI in two steps. First, we developed an AI model (ECGT2T) to synthesize ten-lead ECG from the asynchronized 2-lead ECG (Lead I and II). ECGT2T is a deep learning model based on a generative adversarial network, which translates source ECGs to reference ECGs by learning styles of the reference ECGs. For this, we included adult patients aged ≥18 years from hospital A with at least one digitally stored 12-lead ECG. Second, we developed an AI model to detect HFrEF using a 10 s 12-lead ECG. The AI model was based on convolutional neural network. For this, we included adult patients who underwent ECG and echocardiography within 14 days. To validate the AI, we included adult patients from hospital B who underwent two-lead smartwatch ECG and echocardiography on the same day. The AI model generates a 10 s 12-lead ECG from a two-lead smartwatch ECG using ECGT2T and detects HFrEF using the generated 12-lead ECG. Results: We included 137,673 patients with 458,745 ECGs and 38,643 patients with 88,900 ECGs from hospital A for developing the ECGT2T and HFrEF detection models, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of AI for detecting HFrEF using smartwatch ECG was 0.934 (95% confidence interval 0.913–0.955) with 755 patients from hospital B. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of AI were 0.897, 0.860, 0.258, and 0.994, respectively. Conclusions: An AI-enabled smartwatch 2-lead ECG could detect HFrEF with reasonable performance. © 2022 by the authors.

Despite the criticisms of an 'intelligence without knowledge or reasoning or the notions of truth', ChatGPT is highly effective at human-like conversation with seemingly sophisticated and useful responses to questions, summarization, classification, extraction and generation tasks. Unlike similar large AI models in the modalities of image, audio and video, text-based conversation is straightforward and familiar to a large audience of regular users of the Internet and smartphone applications. This is further accentuated by the large-scale adoption of 'standard' chatbot technologies for trivial conversations in task-specific automation, across every industry sector. This rare combination of highly effective human-like conversation, familiarity of foundational technology and versatility of intelligent application, has led to several challenges and opportunities in leveraging generative AI. A primary challenge is its impact on the academic integrity of scholarly work, where AI-generated content can be useful and detrimental in both teaching and research. On the other hand, ChatGPT presents a unique opportunity in augmenting preexisting ('standard') chatbots with human-like conversation for advanced intelligent automation, across all application domains. Although diametrically opposed, the challenge of addressing academic integrity and the opportunity of augmenting pre-existing chatbots are grounded in the conversational AI capabilities of ChatGPT and similar generative AI models. In this paper, we investigate these formative capabilities and present guidelines for leveraging ChatGPT and similar generative AI models.  © 2023 IEEE.",Academic Integrity; Artificial Intelligence; Chatbot; ChatGPT; Generative AI; GPT3; Intelligent Automation; Pretrained Language Models,Artificial intelligence; Academic integrity; Chatbots; ChatGPT; Generative artificial intelligence; GPT3; Human like; Intelligence models; Intelligent automation; Language model; Pretrained language model; Automation,; ; ,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,979-835033650-4,85RSA,,English,Proc IEEE Int Conf Ind Technol,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163305155

Drawing on a wealth of professional and academic experience, we propose that LLMs hold promise for revolutionizing medical curriculum development, teaching methodologies, personalized study plans and learning materials, student assessments, and more. However, we also critically examine the challenges that such integration might pose by addressing issues of algorithmic bias, overreliance, plagiarism, misinformation, inequity, privacy, and copyright concerns in medical education. As we navigate the shift from an information-driven educational paradigm to an artificial intelligence (AI)–driven educational paradigm, we argue that it is paramount to understand both the potential and the pitfalls of LLMs in medical education. This paper thus offers our perspective on the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs in this context. We believe that the insights gleaned from this analysis will serve as a foundation for future recommendations and best practices in the field, fostering the responsible and effective use of AI technologies in medical education. ©Alaa Abd-alrazaq, Rawan AlSaad, Dari Alhuwail, Arfan Ahmed, Padraig Mark Healy, Syed Latifi, Sarah Aziz, Rafat Damseh, Sadam Alabed Alrazak, Javaid Sheikh.",artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; educators; generative AI; GPT-4; large language models; medical education; students,,"A.

In addition, available public participation computational tools focus mainly on information and idea sharing, leaving the public excluded in design generation because of their lack of design expertise. To address such an issue, this study develops Urban-GAN, a plural urban design computation system, to provide new technical support for design empowerment, allowing the public to generate their own designs. The sub-symbolic representation and artificial intelligence techniques of deep convolutional neural networks, case-based reasoning, and generative adversarial networks are used to acquire and embody design knowledge as the density function, and generate design schemes with this knowledge. The system consists of an urban form database and five process models through which the user with little design expertise can select urban form cases, generate designs similar to those cases, and make design decisions. The Urban-GAN is applied to hypothetical design experiments, which show that the user is able to apply the system to successfully generate distinctive designs following the urban form “styles” in Manhattan, Portland, and Shanghai.

Text-to-image generation, which is one of the multimodal tasks, is a challenging topic in computer vision and natural language processing. The text-to-image generation model based on generative adversarial network (GAN) utilizes a text encoder pre-trained with image-text pairs. However, text encoders pre-trained with image-text pairs cannot obtain rich information about texts not seen during pre-training, thus it is hard to generate an image that semantically matches a given text description. In this paper, we propose a new text-to-image generation model using pre-trained BERT, which is widely used in the field of natural language processing. The pre-trained BERT is used as a text encoder by performing fine-tuning with a large amount of text, so that rich information about the text is obtained and thus suitable for the image generation task. Through experiments using a multimodal benchmark dataset, we show that the proposed method improves the performance over the baseline model both quantitatively and qualitatively. © 2022 by the authors.

One such technology is a dialogue system which is capable of generating humorous and empathetic responses for enhancing students' learning outcomes. There is, however, limited research on the combination of humor, empathy, and culture in education. Thus, this paper proposes a dialogue system that is based on Wasserstein's Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) for generating responses with humor, empathy, and cultural sensitivity. The dialogue system has the ability to generate responses that take into account both coarse-grained emotions at the conversation level and fine-grained emotions at the token level, allowing for a nuanced understanding of a student's emotional state. It can utilize external knowledge and prior context to enhance the ability of AI dialogue systems to comprehend emotions in a multimodal context. It can also analyze large corpora of text and other data, providing valuable insights into cultural context, semantic properties, and language variations. The dialogue system is a promising AI technology that can improve learning outcomes in various academic fields by generating responses with humor, empathy, and cultural sensitivity.

Tools for creativity are increasingly using artificial intelligence to not only support the creative process, but also to act upon the creation with a higher level of agency. This paper focuses on writing fiction as a creative activity and explores human-AI co-writing through a research product, which employs a natural language processing model, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), to assist the co-authoring of narrative fiction. We report on two progressive - not comparative - autoethnographic studies to attain our own creative practices in light of our engagement with the research product: (1) a co-writing activity initiated by basic textual prompts using basic elements of narrative and (2) a co-writing activity initiated by more advanced textual prompts using elements of narrative, including dialects and metaphors undertaken by one of the authors of this paper who has doctoral training in literature. In both studies, we quickly came up against the limitations of the system; then, we repositioned our goals and practices to maximize our chances of success. As a result, we discovered not only limitations but also hidden capabilities, which not only altered our creative practices and outcomes, but which began to change the ways we were relating to the AI as collaborator. © 2022 Owner/Author.",AI co-creativity; Artificial creativity; Creative writing; Creativity tool; GPT-3; Storytelling,Natural language processing systems; AI co-creativity; Artificial creativity; Creative process; Creative writings; Creatives; Creativity tool; Generative pre-trained transformer 3; Human creativity; Storytelling; Writing activities; Artificial intelligence,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,978-145039955-5,,,English,ACM Int.

The artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot has caused alarm for practitioners seeking to detect authenticity of student work. Whereas some educational doomsayers predict the end of education in its current form, we propose an alternate early view. We identify in this commentary a position where educators can leverage AI like ChatGPT to build supportive learning environments for students who have cultivated good character. Such students know how to use ChatGPT for good, and can engage effectively with the ChatGPT application. In building our ChatGPT argument, we acknowledge the existing literature on plagiarism and academic integrity, and consider leadership as a root support mechanism, character development as an antidote, and authentic assessment as an enabler. In doing so, we highlight that while ChatGPT – like papermills, and degree factories before it – can be used to cheat on university exams, it can also be used to support deeper learning and better learning outcomes for students. In doing so, we offer a commentary that offers opportunities for practitioners, and research potential for scholars. Practitioner Notes 1. OpenAI’s ChatGPT-3 has taken higher education by storm with threats of plagiarism and integrity as key concerns. 2. We argue that effective teacher leadership is needed to develop student character so they use ChatGPT for good, rather than for personal benefit. 3.

The experience of Chinese and domestic construction organizations in this area has been studied. A scheme for the implementation of an artificial intelligence system in construction production has been developed, the necessary resources for the development of machine learning in this area have been analyzed. It is concluded that for correct decision-making it is necessary to apply the principles of discrete mathematics, in particular, the distribution of expert assessments accepted as linguistic variables on the Harrington desirability scale with the construction of the membership function. © 2023, Institute for research and design in industry.

It has been found that the introduction of this tool is both beneficial and problematic. On the one hand, it saves time for the information search, facilitates the research process for both teachers and students through proposing ideas, and creates education-related content that emulates human writing. On the other hand, ChatGPT sometimes outputs biased or unverified information that causes misunderstanding among the participants in the educational process. Moreover, in the case of inappropriate application, this tool limits the creativity of the students and decreases their critical thinking skills. The research is based on a survey (Google Forms) distributed through Facebook groups and university networks all over Ukraine. 1035 educational and pedagogical practitioners and teachers took part in the study. The results obtained from the respondents indicate that there are opportunities for the successful implementation of ChatGPT in the educational process. A significant majority of 83.6% of the respondents confirmed that the impact of AI depends on its usage. The survey also highlights various areas for ChatGPT improvements, such as “understanding context,” “giving more accurate answers,” “improving visual capability,” etc. However, it is inevitable to understand that combining human intellectual capability and ChatGPT potential goes beyond the boundaries of human possibilities, speeds up the process of innovative idea generation, and enables the educational process to be more meaningful and effective. © 2023 by the authors of this article.

Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools that democratize access to generative models are proliferating. ChatGPT, which was released shortly after the first edition of this survey, epitomizes these trends. The great potential of state-of-the-art natural language generation (NLG) systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine-generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing the abuse of NLG models, and presents significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems and 2) the most complete review of machine-generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine-generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models. While doing so, we highlight the importance that detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and accountability.  © 2013 IEEE.",Artificial intelligence; cybersecurity; disinformation; generative AI; large language models; machine learning; text generation; threat modeling; transformer; trustworthy AI,Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Cyber security; Disinformation; Generative AI; Information integrity; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Text detection; Text generations; Threat modeling; Transformer; Trustworthy AI; Artificial intelligence,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,21693536,,,,English,IEEE Access,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164702966

In this study, a novel artificial intelligence (AI) architecture is proposed to predict an accurate flow field and drone rotor thrust from high-resolution particle images. As the ground truth, the flow fields past a high-speed drone rotor obtained from a fast Fourier transform-based cross-correlation algorithm were used along with the thrusts measured by a load cell. Two deep-learning models were developed, and for instantaneous flow-field prediction, a generative adversarial network (GAN) was employed for the first time. It is a spectral-norm-based residual conditional GAN translator that provides a stable adversarial training and high-quality flow generation. Its prediction accuracy is 97.21 % (coefficient of determination, or R2). Subsequently, a deep convolutional neural network was trained to predict the instantaneous rotor thrust from the flow field, and the model is the first AI architecture to predict the thrust. Based on an input of the generated flow field, the network had an R2 accuracy of 94.57 %. To understand the prediction pathways, the internal part of the model was investigated using a class activation map. The results showed that the model recognized the area receiving kinetic energy from the rotor and successfully made a prediction. The proposed architecture is accurate and nearly 600 times faster than the cross-correlation PIV method for real-world complex turbulent flows. In this study, the rotor thrust was calculated directly from the flow field using deep learning for the first time. © The Author(s), 2022.

As attention is primarily focused on student misuse of the technology, the potential affordances of generative AI tools may often be overlooked. In this paper we highlight potential affordances of AI generative tools, such as ChatGPT, for creating language learning and teaching materials and assessments. We offer suggestions on crafting prompts as well as provide example prompts and the materials and assessments generated by ChatGPT in response. We also present a framework for evaluation that combines both of Hubbard’s (1988) framework for CALL evaluation and The Douglas Fir Group’s (2016) transdisciplinary framework that may assist language educators in determining when it is appropriate to leverage generative AI tools. We then briefly illustrate how the framework has been used in our own evaluations. Finally, we suggest language educators consider how the concerns and opinions of using AI-based tools held by individuals and institutions within their own micro, meso, and macro sociocultural levels align or conflict with those of the individuals and institutions of their students’ micro, meso, and macro sociocultural levels. © 2023, Teaching English with Technology.

This study aimed to develop an image-based deep-learning technique to generate delayed uptake patterns of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) images using only early-phase images obtained from 0–20 min after radiotracer injection. Methods: We prepared pairs of early and delayed [11C]PiB dynamic images from 253 patients (cognitively normal n = 32, fronto-temporal dementia n = 39, mild cognitive impairment n = 19, Alzheimer’s disease n = 163) as a training dataset. The neural network was trained with the early images as the input, and the output was the corresponding delayed image. A U-net convolutional neural network (CNN) and a conditional generative adversarial network (C-GAN) were used for the deep-learning architecture and the data augmentation methods, respectively. Then, an independent test data set consisting of early-phase amyloid PET images (n = 19) was used to generate corresponding delayed images using the trained network. Two nuclear medicine physicians interpreted the actual delayed images and predicted delayed images for amyloid positivity. In addition, the concordance of the actual delayed and predicted delayed images was assessed statistically. Results: The concordance of amyloid positivity between the actual versus AI-predicted delayed images was 79%(κ = 0.60) and 79% (κ = 0.59) for each physician, respectively. In addition, the physicians’ agreement rate was at 89% (κ = 0.79) when the same image was interpreted. And, the actual versus AI-predicted delayed images were not readily distinguishable (correct answer rate, 55% and 47% for each physician, respectively). The statistical comparison of the actual versus the predicted delated images indicated that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) was 21.8 dB ± 2.2 dB, and the structural similarity index (SSIM) was 0.45 ± 0.04. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of an image-based deep-learning framework to predict delayed patterns of Amyloid PET uptake using only the early phase images. This AI-based image generation method has the potential to reduce scan time for amyloid PET and increase the patient throughput, without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy for amyloid positivity. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.",Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid PET; Deep learning; Prediction,"Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloidosis; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Positron-Emission Tomography; Signal-To-Noise Ratio; amyloid; Pittsburgh compound B; tracer; amyloid; aged; Article; artificial intelligence; cognition assessment; computer prediction; controlled study; convolutional neural network; deep learning; deep neural network; delayed diagnosis; diagnosis related group; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; frontal lobe; human; intrarater reliability; major clinical study; male; medical procedures; nuclear medicine technician; positivity rate; positron emission tomography; predictive value; radiologist; recall bias; signal noise ratio; standardized uptake value ratio; temporal lobe; writing; Alzheimer disease; amyloidosis; diagnostic imaging; image processing; positron emission tomography; procedures","D.J.

The capacity of LLMs to assist in the full scope of iterative clinical reasoning via successive prompting, in effect acting as artificial physicians, has not yet been evaluated. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate ChatGPT’s capacity for ongoing clinical decision support via its performance on standardized clinical vignettes. Methods: We inputted all 36 published clinical vignettes from the Merck Sharpe & Dohme (MSD) Clinical Manual into ChatGPT and compared its accuracy on differential diagnoses, diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and management based on patient age, gender, and case acuity. Accuracy was measured by the proportion of correct responses to the questions posed within the clinical vignettes tested, as calculated by human scorers. We further conducted linear regression to assess the contributing factors toward ChatGPT’s performance on clinical tasks. Results: ChatGPT achieved an overall accuracy of 71.7% (95% CI 69.3%-74.1%) across all 36 clinical vignettes. The LLM demonstrated the highest performance in making a final diagnosis with an accuracy of 76.9% (95% CI 67.8%-86.1%) and the lowest performance in generating an initial differential diagnosis with an accuracy of 60.3% (95% CI 54.2%-66.6%). Compared to answering questions about general medical knowledge, ChatGPT demonstrated inferior performance on differential diagnosis (β=–15.8%; P<.001) and clinical management (β=–7.4%; P=.02) question types. Conclusions: ChatGPT achieves impressive accuracy in clinical decision-making, with increasing strength as it gains more clinical information at its disposal. In particular, ChatGPT demonstrates the greatest accuracy in tasks of final diagnosis as compared to initial diagnosis. Limitations include possible model hallucinations and the unclear composition of ChatGPT’s training data set. ©Arya Rao, Michael Pang, John Kim, Meghana Kamineni, Winston Lie, Anoop K Prasad, Adam Landman, Keith Dreyer, Marc D Succi.",accuracy; AI; artificial intelligence; chatbot; ChatGPT; clinical decision support; clinical vignettes; decision-making; development; Generative Pre-trained Transformer; GPT; large language models; LLMs; usability; utility,Acceptance and Commitment Therapy; Artificial Intelligence; Clinical Decision-Making; Humans; Organizations; Workflow; adult; age; Article; ChatGPT; clinical decision support system; clinical feature; clinical reasoning; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; female; gender; human; male; pheochromocytoma; professional knowledge; testis cancer; usability; utility value; vignette; workflow; acceptance and commitment therapy; artificial intelligence; clinical decision making; organization; workflow,"M.D. Succi; Medically Engineered Solutions in Healthcare Incubator, Innovation in Operations Research Center (MESH IO), Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, United States; email: msucci@partners.org",,JMIR Publications Inc.,14388871,,,37606976,English,J.

The emergence of tools like ChatGPT has raised concerns about plagiarism detection but also presents opportunities for educators to leverage AI to build supportive learning environments. In this commentary, we explore the potential of AI-augmented teaching and learning practice in higher education, discussing both the productive affordances and challenges associated with these technologies. We offer instructional advice for writing instructional text to guide the generation of quality outputs from AI models, as well as a case study to illustrate using AI for assessment design. Ultimately, we suggest that AI should be seen as one tool among many that can be used to enhance teaching and learning outcomes in higher education. Practitioner Notes 1. Learning to write effective instructional prompts for AI models will help augment learning and teaching practice. 2. AI models offer the potential for significant productive affordances, including personalised feedback, adaptive learning pathways, and enhanced student engagement. 3. To successfully integrate AI into higher education, institutions must prioritise faculty development programs that provide training and support for educators to effectively use these technologies in the classroom. 4. Institutions must ensure that AI is used in a way that aligns with their values and mission and that students are informed about how their data is being used. 5. It is important to recognise that AI is not a panacea for all of the challenges facing higher education. Rather, it should be seen as one tool among many that can be used to enhance teaching and learning outcomes. © 2023, University of Wollongong.

For instance, AI algorithms can forecast the properties of prospective new materials, speeding up the process of sorbent material innovation. With the ability to analyze vast datasets related to processes, machine learning driven by data can enhance operations to reduce energy wastage and improve error detection. The recent rise of Generative Pretrained Transformer models (GPT) has motivated researchers to construct specialized large-scale language models (LLM) based on a comprehensive scientific corpus of papers, reference materials, and knowledge bases.

Rigorous trials are required to understand the capabilities of emerging technology, so that innovation can be directed to benefit patients and practitioners. Objective: Here, we evaluated the strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT in primary care using the Membership of the Royal College of General Practitioners Applied Knowledge Test (AKT) as a medium. Methods: AKT questions were sourced from a web-based question bank and 2 AKT practice papers. In total, 674 unique AKT questions were inputted to ChatGPT, with the model’s answers recorded and compared to correct answers provided by the Royal College of General Practitioners. Each question was inputted twice in separate ChatGPT sessions, with answers on repeated trials compared to gauge consistency. Subject difficulty was gauged by referring to examiners’ reports from 2018 to 2022. Novel explanations from ChatGPT—defined as information provided that was not inputted within the question or multiple answer choices—were recorded. Performance was analyzed with respect to subject, difficulty, question source, and novel model outputs to explore ChatGPT’s strengths and weaknesses. Results: Average overall performance of ChatGPT was 60.17%, which is below the mean passing mark in the last 2 years (70.42%). Accuracy differed between sources (P=.04 and .06). ChatGPT’s performance varied with subject category (P=.02 and .02), but variation did not correlate with difficulty (Spearman ρ=–0.241 and –0.238; P=.19 and .20). The proclivity of ChatGPT to provide novel explanations did not affect accuracy (P>.99 and .23). Conclusions: Large language models are approaching human expert–level performance, although further development is required to match the performance of qualified primary care physicians in the AKT. Validated high-performance models may serve as assistants or autonomous clinical tools to ameliorate the general practice workforce crisis. ©Arun James Thirunavukarasu, Refaat Hassan, Shathar Mahmood, Rohan Sanghera, Kara Barzangi, Mohanned El Mukashfi, Sachin Shah.",AI; artificial intelligence; chatbot; ChatGPT; decision support techniques; deep learning; family medicine; general practice; large language model; natural language processing; primary care,,"A.J.

GPT has achieved previously unheard-of levels of accuracy in most computerized language processing tasks and their chat-based variations. Aim: The aim of this study was to investigate the problem-solving abilities of ChatGPT using two sets of verbal insight problems, with a known performance level established by a sample of human participants. Materials and methods: A total of 30 problems labeled as “practice problems” and “transfer problems” were administered to ChatGPT. ChatGPT's answers received a score of “0” for each incorrectly answered problem and a score of “1” for each correct response. The highest possible score for both the practice and transfer problems was 15 out of 15. The solution rate for each problem (based on a sample of 20 subjects) was used to assess and compare the performance of ChatGPT with that of human subjects. Results: The study highlighted that ChatGPT can be trained in out-of-the-box thinking and demonstrated potential in solving verbal insight problems. The global performance of ChatGPT equalled the most probable outcome for the human sample in both practice problems and transfer problems as well as upon their combination. Additionally, ChatGPT answer combinations were among the 5% of most probable outcomes for the human sample both when considering practice problems and pooled problem sets. These findings demonstrate that ChatGPT performance on both set of problems was in line with the mean rate of success of human subjects, indicating that it performed reasonably well. Conclusions: The use of transformer architecture and self-attention in ChatGPT may have helped to prioritize inputs while predicting, contributing to its potential in verbal insight problem-solving. ChatGPT has shown potential in solving insight problems, thus highlighting the importance of incorporating AI into psychological research. However, it is acknowledged that there are still open challenges. Indeed, further research is required to fully understand AI's capabilities and limitations in verbal problem-solving.

As such, it connects Vision and Language in a generative fashion, with applications that range from multi-modal search engines to help visually impaired people. Although recent years have witnessed an increase in accuracy in such models, this has also brought increasing complexity and challenges in interpretability and visualization. In this work, we focus on Transformer-based image captioning models and provide qualitative and quantitative tools to increase interpretability and assess the grounding and temporal alignment capabilities of such models. Firstly, we employ attribution methods to visualize what the model concentrates on in the input image, at each step of the generation. Further, we propose metrics to evaluate the temporal alignment between model predictions and attribution scores, which allows measuring the grounding capabilities of the model and spot hallucination flaws. Experiments are conducted on three different Transformer-based architectures, employing both traditional and Vision Transformer-based visual features.  © 2022-The authors.

Artificial intelligence has shown the potential to generate PET images from non-corrected PET images. Our aim in this work is to develop a CT-free correction for a long axial FOV PET scanner. Methods: Whole body PET images of 165 patients scanned with a digital regular FOV PET scanner (Biograph Vision 600 (Siemens Healthineers) in Shanghai and Bern) was included for the development and testing of the deep learning methods. Furthermore, the developed algorithm was tested on data of 7 patients scanned with a long axial FOV scanner (Biograph Vision Quadra, Siemens Healthineers). A 2D generative adversarial network (GAN) was developed featuring a residual dense block, which enables the model to fully exploit hierarchical features from all network layers. The normalized root mean squared error (NRMSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), were calculated to evaluate the results generated by deep learning. Results: The preliminary results showed that, the developed deep learning method achieved an average NRMSE of 0.4±0.3% and PSNR of 51.4±6.4 for the test on Biograph Vision, and an average NRMSE of 0.5±0.4% and PSNR of 47.9±9.4 for the validation on Biograph Vision Quadra, after applied transfer learning. Conclusion: The developed deep learning method shows the potential for CT-free AI-correction for a long axial FOV PET scanner. Work in progress includes clinical assessment of PET images by independent nuclear medicine physicians. Training and fine-tuning with more datasets will be performed to further consolidate the development. © 2021 IEEE.",attenuation correction; CT-free; deep learning; scatter correction; total-body PET,"Artificial Intelligence; China; Deep Learning; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Positron-Emission Tomography; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Mean square error; Medical imaging; Network layers; Nuclear medicine; Scanning; Signal to noise ratio; Attenuation correction; Axial field of views; Computed tomography-free; Deep learning; Learning methods; Peak signal to noise ratio; Positron emission tomography scanners; Root mean squared errors; Scatter-correction; Total-body positron emission tomography; artificial intelligence; China; human; image processing; positron emission tomography; x-ray computed tomography; Positron emission tomography",,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1557170X,978-172811179-7,,34892133,English,Proc.

This can be automated using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery of damages. Numerous computer vision-based approaches have been applied to address the limitations of crack detection but they have their limitations that can be overcome by using various hybrid approaches based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs), an application of the deep learning (DL) method, display remarkable potential for automatically detecting image features such as damages and are less sensitive to image noise. A modified deep hierarchical CNN architecture has been used in this study for crack detection and damage assessment in civil infrastructures. The proposed architecture is based on 16 convolution layers and a cycle generative adversarial network (CycleGAN). For this study, the crack images were collected using UAVs and open-source images of mid to high rise buildings (five stories and above) constructed during 2000 in Sydney, Australia. Conventionally, a CNN network only utilizes the last layer of convolution. However, our proposed network is based on the utility of multiple layers. Another important component of the proposed CNN architecture is the application of guided filtering (GF) and conditional random fields (CRFs) to refine the predicted outputs to get reliable results. Benchmarking data (600 images) of Sydney-based buildings damages was used to test the proposed architecture. The proposed deep hierarchical CNN architecture produced superior performance when evaluated using five methods: GF method, Baseline (BN) method, Deep-Crack BN, Deep-Crack GF, and SegNet. Overall, the GF method outperformed all other methods as indicated by the global accuracy (0.990), class average accuracy (0.939), mean intersection of the union overall classes (IoU) (0.879), precision (0.838), recall (0.879), and F-score (0.8581) values. Overall, the proposed CNN architecture provides the advantages of reduced noise, highly integrated supervision of features, adequate learning, and aggregation of both multi-scale and multilevel features during the training procedure along with the refinement of the overall output predictions. © 2021 by the authors.

Applications in medical imaging are particularly attractive, as images are a powerful means to convey rich information and are extensively utilized in cardiology practice. Departing from other AI approaches in cardiology focused on task automation and pattern recognition, we describe a digital health platform to synthesize enhanced, yet familiar, clinical images to augment the cardiologist's visual clinical workflow. In this article, we present the framework, technical fundamentals, and functional applications of the methodology, especially as it pertains to intravascular imaging. A conditional generative adversarial network was trained with annotated images of atherosclerotic diseased arteries to generate synthetic optical coherence tomography and intravascular ultrasound images on the basis of specified plaque morphology. Systems leveraging this unique and flexible construct, whereby a pair of neural networks is competitively trained in tandem, can rapidly generate useful images. These synthetic images replicate the style, and in several ways exceed the content and function, of normally acquired images. By using this technique and employing AI in such applications, one can ameliorate challenges in image quality, interpretability, coherence, completeness, and granularity, thereby enhancing medical education and clinical decision-making. © 2021 The Author(s).

Recent works on publicly available pharmaceutical data showed that AI methods are highly promising for Drug Target prediction. However, the quality of public data might be different than that of industry data due to different labs reporting measurements, different measurement techniques, fewer samples and less diverse and specialized assays. As part of a European funded project (ExCAPE), that brought together expertise from pharmaceutical industry, machine learning, and high-performance computing, we investigated how well machine learning models obtained from public data can be transferred to internal pharmaceutical industry data. Our results show that machine learning models trained on public data can indeed maintain their predictive power to a large degree when applied to industry data. Moreover, we observed that deep learning derived machine learning models outperformed comparable models, which were trained by other machine learning algorithms, when applied to internal pharmaceutical company datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale study evaluating the potential of machine learning and especially deep learning directly at the level of industry-scale settings and moreover investigating the transferability of publicly learned target prediction models towards industrial bioactivity prediction pipelines. © 2020 The Author(s).",Big data; ChEMBL; Cheminformatics; Deep learning; Machine learning; Prospective evaluation; PubChem; QSAR; Retrospective evaluation; Structure-based virtual screening,,"N.

We propose a novel, generative adversarial framework for probing and improving these models' reasoning capabilities. Adversarial attacks in this domain suffer from the logical inconsistency problem, whereby perturbations to the input may alter the label. Our Logically consistent AdVersarial Attacker, LAVA, addresses this by combining a structured generative process with a symbolic solver, guaranteeing logical consistency. Our framework successfully generates adversarial attacks and identifies global weaknesses common across multiple target models. Our analyses reveal naive heuristics and vulnerabilities in these models' reasoning capabilities, exposing an incomplete grasp of logical deduction under logic programs. Finally, in addition to effective probing of these models, we show that training on the generated samples improves the target model's performance. © 2022 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

This paper studies the problem of classifying structural faults in such an accelerator based on their functional criticality. We analyze the impact of stuck-At faults in the processing elements (PEs) of a 128 \times 128 systolic array designed to perform classification on the MNIST dataset using both 32-bit and 16-bit data paths. We present a two-Tier machine-learning (ML) based method to assess the functional criticality of these faults. We address the problem of minimizing misclassification by utilizing generative adversarial networks (GANs). The two-Tier ML/GAN-based criticality assessment method leads to less than 1% test escapes during functional criticality evaluation.  © 2020 IEEE.,,Classification (of information); Criticality (nuclear fission); Deep neural networks; Systolic arrays; Adversarial networks; Criticality assessment; Criticality evaluations; Misclassifications; Processing elements; Structural faults; Stuck-at faults; Ubiquitous application; Artificial intelligence,,,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,10893539,978-172819113-3,PITCF,,English,Proc.

A barrier is the need to generate and constantly post novel but on-topic messages, which creates a resource-intensive bottleneck. Objective: In this study, we aim to harness the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to build a pilot system that can generate many candidate messages, which could be used for a campaign to suggest novel, on-topic candidate messages. The issue of folic acid, a B-vitamin that helps prevent major birth defects, serves as an example; however, the system can work with other issues that could benefit from higher levels of public awareness. Methods: We used the Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 architecture, a machine learning model trained on a large natural language corpus, and fine-tuned it using a data set of autodownloaded tweets about #folicacid. The fine-tuned model was then used as a message engine, that is, to create new messages about this topic. We conducted a web-based study to gauge how human raters evaluate AI-generated tweet messages compared with original, human-crafted messages. Results: We found that the Folic Acid Message Engine can easily create several hundreds of new messages that appear natural to humans. Web-based raters evaluated the clarity and quality of a human-curated sample of AI-generated messages as on par with human-generated ones. Overall, these results showed that it is feasible to use such a message engine to suggest messages for web-based campaigns that focus on promoting awareness. Conclusions: The message engine can serve as a starting point for more sophisticated AI-guided message creation systems for health communication. Beyond the practical potential of such systems for campaigns in the age of social media, they also hold great scientific potential for the quantitative analysis of message characteristics that promote successful communication. We discuss future developments and obvious ethical challenges that need to be addressed as AI technologies for health persuasion enter the stage. © Ralf Schmälzle, Shelby Wilcox.",Campaigns; Health communication; Health promotion; Human-centered AI; NLP,Artificial Intelligence; Folic Acid; Health Communication; Humans; Persuasive Communication; Social Media; folic acid; folic acid; Article; artificial intelligence; comparative study; detection algorithm; Health Belief Model; health promotion; human; machine learning; medical information; natural language processing; persuasive communication; pregnancy; public health campaign; public health message; quantitative analysis; self concept; social media; artificial intelligence; social media,"R.

The most known applications have occurred in areas such as image synthesis for face generation as well as in natural language generation. In terms of tools for music composition, several systems have been released in the latest years, but there is still space for improving the possibilities of music co-creation with neural generative tools. In this context, we introduce Latent Chords, a system based on a Variational Autoencoder architecture which learns a latent space by reconstructing piano chords. We provide details of the neural architecture, the training process and we also show how Latent Chords can be used for a controllable exploration of chord sounds as well as to generate new chords by manipulating the latent representation. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

SOLS approach provides a framework for the creation of self-generated artificial languages and may serve as a starting point for the development of context-dependent or domain-specific languages. It acknowledges that the development of conlangs can happen in artificial societies of simple agents, as the output of social interactions in computational simulations under the agent-based modelling paradigm. In the proposed initial SOLS model, automatic generation of lexicon takes place in the context of a digital environment with objects, actions and agents with embodied cognition through peer-to-peer interactions. Specifically, this paper exposes how SOLS can be developed with bi-dimensional games and simulations. An initial work has been done with the xmunch-atomspace and the SciArt simulator, which constitute the first implementations of both our knowledge representation toolbox and our bi-dimensional simulator of P2P Social Dynamics. Non-interactive agent-based SOLS can allow artificial agents to independently evolve emergent languages as part of their self-organizing or adaptation processes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Agent-based modelling; Artificial intelligence; Conlangs; Constructed languages; Emergence; Self-organization,artificial intelligence; bottom-up approach; emergence; language; numerical model; self organization,"D.

However, progress is slow. Legal and ethical issues around unconsented patient data and privacy is one of the limiting factors in data sharing, resulting in a significant barrier in accessing routinely collected electronic health records (EHR) by the machine learning community. We propose a novel framework for generating synthetic data that closely approximates the joint distribution of variables in an original EHR dataset, providing a readily accessible, legally and ethically appropriate solution to support more open data sharing, enabling the development of AI solutions. In order to address issues around lack of clarity in defining sufficient anonymization, we created a quantifiable, mathematical definition for 'identifiability'. We used a conditional generative adversarial networks (GAN) framework to generate synthetic data while minimize patient identifiability that is defined based on the probability of re-identification given the combination of all data on any individual patient. We compared models fitted to our synthetically generated data to those fitted to the real data across four independent datasets to evaluate similarity in model performance, while assessing the extent to which original observations can be identified from the synthetic data. Our model, ADS-GAN, consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, and demonstrated reliability in the joint distributions. We propose that this method could be used to develop datasets that can be made publicly available while considerably lowering the risk of breaching patient confidentiality. © 2013 IEEE.",anonymization; electronic health records; generative adversarial networks; identifiability; Synthetic data generation,"Data Anonymization; Electronic Health Records; Female; Humans; Information Dissemination; Male; Neural Networks, Computer; Electronic document exchange; Hospital data processing; Machine learning; Open Data; Adversarial networks; Electronic health record; Joint distributions; Machine learning communities; Mathematical definitions; Patient confidentiality; Re identifications; State-of-the-art methods; adult; anonymization; article; artificial intelligence; confidentiality; data synthesis; electronic health record; human; probability; reliability; risk assessment; female; information dissemination; male; procedures; Data Sharing","J.

Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a question about the image, the agent has to ground the question in image, infer context from history, and answer the question accurately. Visual Dialog is disentangled enough from a specific downstream task so as to serve as a general test of machine intelligence, while being sufficiently grounded in vision to allow objective evaluation of individual responses and benchmark progress. We develop a novel two-person real-time chat data-collection protocol to curate a large-scale Visual Dialog dataset (VisDial). VisDial v0.9 has been released and consists of ∼1.2M dialog question-answer pairs from 10-round, human-human dialogs grounded in ∼120k images from the COCO dataset. We introduce a family of neural encoder-decoder models for Visual Dialog with 3 encoders - Late Fusion, Hierarchical Recurrent Encoder and Memory Network (optionally with attention over image features) - and 2 decoders (generative and discriminative), which outperform a number of sophisticated baselines. We propose a retrieval-based evaluation protocol for Visual Dialog where the AI agent is asked to sort a set of candidate answers and evaluated on metrics such as mean-reciprocal-rank and recall@k of human response. We quantify the gap between machine and human performance on the Visual Dialog task via human studies. Putting it all together, we demonstrate the first 'visual chatbot'!

A transformer in AI is a tool that acts as a kind of training model to train the pre-trained models. Available pre-trained models can reduce computational cost, carbon foot print and saves time. A transformer model can be used for different modalities such as text, images, audio and even for multi-model including video classification and visual question answering.

New generative techniques, such as unsupervised neural machine translation (NMT), have recently been applied to the task of generating source code, translating it from one programming language to another. The artifacts produced in this way may contain imperfections, such as compilation or logical errors. We examine the extent to which software engineers would tolerate such imperfections and explore ways to aid the detection and correction of those errors. Using a design scenario approach, we interviewed 11 software engineers to understand their reactions to the use of an NMT model in the context of application modernization, focusing on the task of translating source code from one language to another. Our three-stage scenario sparked discussions about the utility and desirability of working with an imperfect AI system, how acceptance of that system's outputs would be established, and future opportunities for generative AI in application modernization. Our study highlights how UI features such as confidence highlighting and alternate translations help software engineers work with and better understand generative NMT models.  © 2021 ACM.",application modernization; code translation; generative AI; imperfect AI; neural machine translation; NMT,Application programs; Computer aided language translation; Engineers; Program translators; User interfaces; AI systems; Code translation; Generative model; Human like; Logical errors; Machine translations; Scenario approach; Source codes; Artificial intelligence,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,978-145038017-1,,,English,Int Conf Intell User Interfaces Proc IUI,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104548499

However, deep learning (DL) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated. Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies.

These artificial intelligence (AI) systems are expected to be safe and intelligent, adapt to changing environments, and interact with other actors, both automated and human. In this paper, we present a framework and corresponding analytics for developing AI agents that possess (1) cognitive skills, including the ability to perform counter-factual reasoning and self-assessment and to exhibit human-like curiosity, biases, and errors; (2) the ability to learn complex tasks quickly with limited feedback; (3) the ability to coordinate and co-learn with human or AI teammates; and (4) the ability to function well over long time horizons (e.g. hours or days). Our framework is based on the theory of adaptive behavior called active inference, which was developed in computational neuroscience and psychology. Together with learnable deep factorized representations, the active inference provides the objective function, high-capacity predictions, and scalable computational mechanisms that enable AI agents to execute four processes fundamental to human cognition: learning, perception, planning, and simulation. We demonstrate the advantages of our AI solution in the domain of planning multi-agent maneuvers for executing area control missions. Our model achieves faster learning compared to the reinforcement learning baseline, producing faster point accumulation and game win rate.  © 2021 SPIE.",active inference; adaptive and curious AI; adaptive planning; Bayesian reasoning; deep generative models; multi-agent systems; perception-control loop; planning as inference; uncertainty reduction,Computation theory; Multi agent systems; Reinforcement learning; Adaptive behavior; Artificial agents; Autonomous systems; Changing environment; Dynamic uncertain environments; Human cognition; Limited feedback; Objective functions; Computational neuroscience,,Blowers M.; Hall R.D.; Dasari V.R.,SPIE,0277786X,978-151064339-0,PSISD,,English,Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107852635

This holds the potential to generate relevant quizzes for any educational text, greatly complementing current formative and summative tests from education professionals. We explore pre-trained language models for quiz generation on reading comprehension texts and propose EduQuiz, an end-to-end quiz generator based on a GPT-3 model fine-tuned on text-quiz pairs, able to generate a complete multiple-choice question, with the correct and distractor answers. We observed that the majority of generated quizzes is reasonable, and that generation of high-quality distractors is more challenging than question and answer generation. More generally, while it may be too early to replace manually generated tests for summative feedback and grading with automatic quiz generation, EduQuiz already has potential value for formative feedback and to increase engagement during the learning phase by enhancing textbooks with assessments.

This paper presents mPLUG, a new vision-language foundation model for both cross-modal understanding and generation. Most existing pre-trained models suffer from inefficiency and linguistic signal overwhelmed by long visual sequences in cross-modal alignment. To address both problems, mPLUG introduces an effective and efficient vision-language architecture with novel cross-modal skip-connections. mPLUG is pre-trained end-to-end on large-scale image-text pairs with both discriminative and generative objectives. It achieves state-of-the-art results on a wide range of vision-language downstream tasks, including image captioning, image-text retrieval, visual grounding and visual question answering. mPLUG also demonstrates strong zero-shot transferability on vision-language and video-language tasks.

New AI algorithms are constantly emerging, with each 'strain' mimicking a new form of human learning, reasoning, knowledge, and decisionmaking. The current main disrupting forms of learning include Deep Learning, Adversarial Learning, Transfer and Meta Learning. Albeit these modes of learning have been in the AI/ML field more than a decade, they now are more applicable due to the availability of data, computing power and infrastructure. These forms of learning have produced new models (e.g., Long Short-Term Memory, Generative Adversarial Networks) and leverage important applications (e.g., Natural Language Processing, Adversarial Examples, Deep Fakes, etc.). These new models and applications will drive changes in future Capital Markets, so it is important to understand their computational strengths and weaknesses. Since ML algorithms effectively self-program and evolve dynamically, financial institutions and regulators are becoming increasingly concerned with ensuring there remains a modicum of human control, focusing on Algorithmic Interpretability/Explainability, Robustness and Legality. For example, the concern is that, in the future, an ecology of trading algorithms across different institutions may 'conspire' and become unintentionally fraudulent (cf. LIBOR) or subject to subversion through compromised datasets (e.g. Microsoft Tay). New and unique forms of systemic risks can emerge, potentially coming from excessive algorithmic complexity. The contribution of this paper is to review AI, ML and associated algorithms, their computational strengths and weaknesses, and discuss their future impact on the Capital Markets.  © 2020 ACM.",Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Finance; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning; Transfer learning,Commerce; Computational complexity; Deep learning; Digital storage; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Parallel processing systems; 'current; Adversarial learning; Artificial intelligence algorithms; Deep learning; Human decision-making; Human learning; Human reasoning; Machine-learning; New forms; Transfer learning; Generative adversarial networks,"A.

Recently, there is no area where AI and its applications are not used in daily life, from health to education, from transportation to energy, and from agriculture to tourism. AI applications are making rapid progress in the direction of important and current developments, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL). A concrete example of progress in these areas is the GPT-3 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3) language model. AI-assisted GPT-3 technology is the DL model that is effectively used in many NLP fields, which can produce long and consistent content similar to the texts written by people using pre-trained algorithms. The GPT-3 architecture has reached a level that can compete with people in many areas by producing optimum solutions for all kinds of inputs by using the Transformer-based language model, which is an attention-based deep learning technique. This article aims to convey the efficiency, structure and potential of the Transformer-assisted GPT-3 model, which is one of the most up-to-date NLP technologies, to the reader. Since the number of Turkish studies in the field of GPT-3 AI is quite limited, it is considered that this study will contribute to the literature in terms of both quantity and quality. In addition, the performance parameters of the model were examined by making a customized fine-tuned sample application in the beta version of the GPT-3 model. © 2022 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Deep Learning; GPT-3; Natural Language Processing; Transformer,Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Artificial intelligence technologies; Deep learning; Generative pre-trained transformer 3; ITS applications; Language model; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Pre-training; Transformer; Deep learning,,Varol A.; Karabatak M.; Varol C.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166545995-2,,,English,"Int.

Although there is a variety of machine learning frameworks on the market, there is little support for process automation and DevOps in machine learning-driven projects. In this paper, we discuss how metamodels can support the development of deep learning frameworks and help deal with the steadily increasing variety of learning algorithms. In particular, we present a deep learning-oriented artifact model which serves as a foundation for build automation and data management in iterative, machine learning-driven development processes. Furthermore, we show how schema and reference models can be used to structure and maintain a versatile deep learning framework.

We perform a study to investigate the behaviors of an AI diagnosis model under adversarial images generated by Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) models and to evaluate the effects on human experts when visually identifying potential adversarial images. Our GAN model makes intentional modifications to the diagnosis-sensitive contents of mammogram images in deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of breast cancer. In our experiments the adversarial samples fool the AI-CAD model to output a wrong diagnosis on 69.1% of the cases that are initially correctly classified by the AI-CAD model. Five breast imaging radiologists visually identify 29%-71% of the adversarial samples.

While extensive research has been carried out in the said domain, most existing systems do not achieve optimum voice naturalization, one probable reason of which can be attributed to the inability of systems to accurately map the user's native dialect. Aiming to tackle this pitfall, this research proposes a generative decoder model which aims to clone the user's voice while capturing the native accent and linguistic features of the speaker to provide a more naturalized synthesized output voice. The proposed methodology achieves an equal error rate of 0.051 for the speaker encoder module of the system, while achieving an accuracy of 98.12% on the accent adaptation module of the system. © 2022 Acta Press.

Applications of, and media generated by generative AI techniques are abundantly present on social media platforms frequented by children, who are not yet aware of the existence of AI-manipulated media. Previous work has highlighted the importance of digital media literacy and AI literacy for children. In this work, we introduce middle school students to generative AI techniques as a tool for creation, while also focusing on critical discussion about their societal and ethical implications, and encouraging pro-activeness in being responsible consumers, creators and stakeholders of technology. We present learning activities that introduce 38 middle-school students to generative modeling, how it is used to generate Deepfakes, cues that help to recognize Deepfakes, and the spread and effects of misinformation. Students demonstrated an understanding that generative media may be believable, but not necessarily true, and can contribute to the spread of misinformation. They were also able to identify why misinformation may be harmful or lasting, drawing specific examples to social settings that indicate human-centered implications. Finally, students expressed opinions about policies surrounding the presence of Deepfakes on social media. This approach can be adopted to introduce students to other technical systems that constitute both productive applications and potential negative implications of technology.

We evaluated how much children learned by using AI assessments we developed for each activity. The median score on the cumulative assessment was 70% and children understood knowledge-based systems the best. Then, we analyzed the impact of the activities on children’s perceptions of robots. Younger children came to see robots as toys that were smarter than them, but their older counterparts saw them more as people that were not as smart as them. Children who performed worse on the AI assessments believed that robots were like toys that were not as smart as them, however children who did better on the assessments saw robots as people who were smarter than them. We believe early AI education can empower children to understand the AI devices that are increasingly in their lives. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",AI education; Child-robot interaction; Early childhood education; Social robots,Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Human computer interaction; Human engineering; Knowledge based systems; Supervised learning; Child-robot interactions; Early childhood educations; Early childhoods; Preschool children; Social robots; Supervised machine learning; Young children; Intelligent robots,,,Association for Computing Machinery,,978-145035970-2,,,English,Conf Hum Fact Comput Syst Proc,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067615092

It's been found to help in tasks like taking notes and reading while writing, as well as improving short and long-term memory. The goal of handwriting synthesis is to create artificial text that closely resembles the user's writing style. Handwriting synthesis not only adds a personal touch or preserves a user's style, but it also has a number of other applications, such as improving text recognition systems, personalizing fonts, identifying writers, and spreading as the technology gets more popular. This paper presents a deep learning model for synthesizing handwriting text from computer text input. The goal is to create an AI tool that can generate handwriting while keeping a person's style, which could potentially help people suffering with Dysgraphia.

Teaching the principles and requirements of ethical AI to students is considered an essential part of this domain, with an increasing number of technical AI courses taught at several higher-education institutions around the globe including content related to ethics. By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative probabilistic topic model, this study uncovers topics in teaching ethics in AI courses and their trends related to where the courses are taught, by whom, and at what level of cognitive complexity and specificity according to Bloom's taxonomy. In this exploratory study based on unsupervised machine learning, we analyzed a total of 166 courses: 116 from North American universities, 11 from Asia, 36 from Europe, and 10 from other regions. Based on this analysis, we were able to synthesize a model of teaching approaches, which we call BAG (Build, Assess, and Govern), that combines specific cognitive levels, course content topics, and disciplines affiliated with the department(s) in charge of the course. We critically assess the implications of this teaching paradigm and provide suggestions about how to move away from these practices. We challenge teaching practitioners and program coordinators to reflect on their usual procedures so that they may expand their methodology beyond the confines of stereotypical thought and traditional biases regarding what disciplines should teach and how.  ©2022 AI Access Foundation.

Arguably the most striking results have been in the area of image synthesis. However, evaluating the performance of GANs is still an open and challenging problem. Existing evaluation metrics primarily measure the dissimilarity between real and generated images using automated statistical methods. They often require large sample sizes for evaluation and do not directly reflect human perception of image quality. In this work, we describe an evaluation metric we call Neuroscore, for evaluating the performance of GANs, that more directly reflects psychoperceptual image quality through the utilization of brain signals. Our results show that Neuroscore has superior performance to the current evaluation metrics in that: (1) It is more consistent with human judgment; (2) The evaluation process needs much smaller numbers of samples; and (3) It is able to rank the quality of images on a per GAN basis. A convolutional neural network (CNN) based neuro-AI interface is proposed to predict Neuroscore from GAN-generated images directly without the need for neural responses. Importantly, we show that including neural responses during the training phase of the network can significantly improve the prediction capability of the proposed model.

The research methods of 'AI + Architecture' have brought new ideas for solving traditional problems. Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a machine learning model for image generation. Pix2pix is an improved version of GAN, which is specially designed to learn and generate pairs of image data with similar characteristics. In this study, Pix2pix is applied to the recognition and generation of building facade. The purpose is to explore the feasibility of using image generation technology to achieve rapid recognition and generation of building facade based on pix2pix. This paper also discusses the application scenarios of this technology. The existing building façade datasets and the self-made Chinese traditional building datasets are used to test and verify that pix2pix under different types of datasets can nicely identify and generate facade images. Then we summarize a set of working methods based on GAN to realize the overall or local reconstruction design of the facade, so as to provide new ideas for the improvement of the efficiency of related industries and the expansion of teaching tools. © 2020 IEEE.",facade; GAN; image generation; image recognition,Big data; Facades; Machine learning; Software engineering; Turing machines; Adversarial networks; Application scenario; Architectural facades; Artificial intelligence technologies; Building facades; Chinese traditional buildings; Image generations; Machine learning models; Image enhancement,"W.

The history of AI technology started from machine learning, convolution neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), then developed to the latest technology of generative adversarial network (GAN). Deep learning is improving quickly. Data augmentation and transfer learning are currently advanced functions in the field of deep learning, which accelerates the whole training of the neural networks and improves model accuracy. This study implements these two functions and analyzes the performance in a deep learning model. Due to our performance study, researchers can make the most efficient AI model. To find a better deep learning model, we evaluate five deep learning strategies. In this way, we compare different learning effects and observe model accuracy. According to analysis charts and data tables, this study shows that transferred deep learning and fine-tune strategy not only increase the accuracy but also give insignificant overfitting. We also prove that fine-tune transfer learning significantly saves more time and costs in future tests and experiments. © 2021 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Deep learning; Machine learning; Neural network; Transfer learning,Engineering education; Long short-term memory; Artificial intelligence technologies; Convolution neural network; Deep learning; Latest technology; Learning models; Modeling accuracy; Neural-networks; Performances analysis; Research issues; Transfer learning; Generative adversarial networks,,Meen T.-H.,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,978-166544516-0,,,English,"Proc.

With the help of generative adversarial edge computing networks, the field has made great strides in high-resolution image synthesis. However, there are still some defects in the authenticity of synthetic single-target images. For example, there will be abnormal situations such as ""multiple heads""and ""multiple mouths""when synthesizing bird graphics. Aiming at such problems, a text generation single-target model SA-AttnGAN based on a self-attention mechanism is proposed. SA-AttnGAN (Attentional Generative Adversarial Network) refines text features into word features and sentence features to improve the semantic alignment of text and images; in the initialization stage of AttnGAN, the self-attention mechanism is used to improve the stability of the text-generated image model; the multistage GAN network is used to superimpose, finally synthesizing high-resolution images. Experimental data show that SA-AttnGAN outperforms other comparable models in terms of Inception Score and Frechet Inception Distance; synthetic image analysis shows that this model can learn background and colour information and correctly capture bird heads and mouths. The structural information of other components is improved, and the AttnGAN model generates incorrect images such as ""multiple heads""and ""multiple mouths.""Furthermore, SA-AttnGAN is successfully applied to description-based clothing image synthesis with good generalization ability. © 2022 Hamdan Ali Alshehri et al.",,Edge computing; Generative adversarial networks; Image enhancement; Semantics; Attention mechanisms; Computing model; Edge computing; High-resolution images; Hotspots; Images synthesis; Language description; Natural languages; Target images; Text generations; Birds,"S.A.

Many features they developed can be inspirational and beneficial for solving technical problems in modern industries. This leads to a specific form of design-by-analogy called bio-inspired design (BID). Although BID as a design method has been proven beneficial, the gap between biology and engineering continuously hinders designers from effectively applying the method. Therefore, we explore the recent advance of artificial intelligence (AI) for a computational approach to bridge the gap. This paper proposes a generative design approach based on the pre-trained language model (PLM) to automatically retrieve and map biological analogy and generate BID in the form of natural language. The latest generative pre-trained transformer, namely GPT-3, is used as the base PLM. Three types of design concept generators are identified and fine-tuned from the PLM according to the looseness of the problem space representation. Machine evaluators are also fine-tuned to assess the correlation between the domains within the generated BID concepts. The approach is then tested via a case study in which the fine-tuned models are applied to generate and evaluate light-weighted flying car concepts inspired by nature. The results show our approach can generate BID concepts with good performance.

This work investigates the vulnerability of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learners to AI-generated misinformation in order to safeguard the public-availability of high-quality online STEM learning content. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased STEM learners' reliance on online learning content. Consequently, safeguarding the veracity of STEM learning content is critical to ensuring the safety and trust that both STEM educators and learners have in publicly-available STEM learning content. In this study, state-of-the-art AI algorithms are trained on a specific STEM context (i.e., climate change) using publicly-available data. STEM learners are then randomly presented with authentic and AI-manipulated STEM learning content and asked to judge the authenticity of the content. The authors introduce an approach that STEM educators can employ to understand correlations between STEM learning topics such as climate change, and students' susceptibility to AI-driven misinformation. The proposed approach has the potential to guide STEM educators as to the STEM topics that may be more difficult to teach (e.g., climate change), given students' susceptibility to AI-driven misinformation that promotes controversial viewpoints. In addition, the proposed approach may inform students themselves as to their susceptibility to AI-driven STEM misinformation so that they are more aware of AI's capabilities and how they could be utilized to alter their viewpoints on a STEM topic. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,Climate change; E-learning; Engineering education; Learning systems; Artificial intelligence techniques; Engineering and mathematics; Engineering learning; Learning contents; Mathematics learning; Neural-networks; Pilot studies; Science learning; Science technologies; Technology learning; Students,,,American Society for Engineering Education,21535965,,,,English,ASEE Annu.

However, the classical methods treat the treatment response as homogeneous and estimate the average treatment effects. The traditional methods are difficult to apply to precision oncology. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful tool for precision oncology. It can accurately estimate the individualized treatment effects and learn optimal treatment choices. Therefore, the AI approach can substantially improve progress and treatment outcomes of patients. One AI approach, conditional generative adversarial nets for inference of individualized treatment effects (GANITE) has been developed. However, GANITE can only deal with binary treatment and does not provide a tool for optimal treatment selection. To overcome these limitations, we modify conditional generative adversarial networks (MCGANs) to allow estimation of individualized effects of any types of treatments including binary, categorical and continuous treatments. We propose to use sparse techniques for selection of biomarkers that predict the best treatment for each patient. Simulations show that MCGANs outperform seven other state-of-the-art methods: linear regression (LR), Bayesian linear ridge regression (BLR), k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), random forest classification [RF (C)], random forest regression [RF (R)], logistic regression (LogR), and support vector machine (SVM). To illustrate their applications, the proposed MCGANs were applied to 256 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who were treated with high dose ara-C (HDAC), Idarubicin (IDA) and both of these two treatments (HDAC+IDA) at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Our results showed that MCGAN can more accurately and robustly estimate the individualized treatment effects than other state-of-the art methods. Several biomarkers such as GSK3, BILIRUBIN, SMAC are identified and a total of 30 biomarkers can explain 36.8% of treatment effect variation. © Copyright © 2020 Ge, Huang, Fang, Guo, Liu, Lin and Xiong.",causal inference; counterfactuals; generative adversarial networks; precision medicine; treatment estimation,bilirubin; biological marker; histone deacetylase; idarubicin; acute myeloid leukemia; apoptosis; Article; artificial neural network; clinical outcome; entropy; feed forward neural network; human; individualized treatment effect; learning algorithm; machine learning; outcome assessment; prediction; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; signal transduction; simulation; stomach cancer; support vector machine; treatment response,"M.

Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging offers non-invasive and non-ionizing assessment of CHD patients. However, although CMR data facilitates reliable analysis of cardiac function and anatomy, clinical workflow mostly relies on manual analysis of CMR images, which is time consuming. Thus, an automated and accurate segmentation platform exclusively dedicated to pediatric CMR images can significantly improve the clinical workflow, as the present work aims to establish. Methods: Training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for CMR analysis requires large annotated datasets, which are not readily available for pediatric subjects and particularly in CHD patients. To mitigate this issue, we devised a novel method that uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to synthetically augment the training dataset via generating synthetic CMR images and their corresponding chamber segmentations. In addition, we trained and validated a deep fully convolutional network (FCN) on a dataset, consisting of 64 pediatric subjects with complex CHD, which we made publicly available. Dice metric, Jaccard index and Hausdorff distance as well as clinically-relevant volumetric indices are reported to assess and compare our platform with other algorithms including U-Net and cvi42, which is used in clinics. Results: For congenital CMR dataset, our FCN model yields an average Dice metric of 91.0 % and 86.8 % for LV at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively, and 84.7 % and 80.6 % for RV at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively. Using the same dataset, the cvi42, resulted in 73.2 % , 71.0 % , 54.3 % and 53.7 % for LV and RV at end-diastole and end-systole, and the U-Net architecture resulted in 87.4 % , 83.9 % , 81.8 % and 74.8 % for LV and RV at end-diastole and end-systole, respectively. Conclusions: The chambers’ segmentation results from our fully-automated method showed strong agreement with manual segmentation and no significant statistical difference was found by two independent statistical analyses. Whereas cvi42 and U-Net segmentation results failed to pass the t-test. Relying on these outcomes, it can be inferred that by taking advantage of GANs, our method is clinically relevant and can be used for pediatric and congenital CMR segmentation and analysis. © 2020, The Author(s).",CMR image analysis; Complex CHD analysis; Deep learning; Fully convolutional networks; Generative adversarial networks; Machine learning,"Adolescent; Age Factors; Automation; Child; Child, Preschool; Deep Learning; Female; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Workflow; adolescent; adult; Article; artificial intelligence; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; child; cohort analysis; congenital heart disease; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; diastole; fully convolutional network; generative adversarial network; heart left ventricle; heart right ventricle; human; image analysis; image processing; image segmentation; major clinical study; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; systole; age; automation; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; female; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; predictive value; preschool child; reproducibility; workflow","H.

However, the university has rich data resources and complex management, and how to construct a comprehensive, standardized, efficient, and shared university information services platform has become a research hotspot. In recent years, the progress of artificial intelligence (AI) in many aspects has created opportunities for its large-scale application in smart campuses. With the wide penetration of AI technology into all walks of life, especially in the fields of industry, commerce, finance, security, and so on, some technologies have experienced practical tests. Many scholars have discussed the significance and possibility of the application of AI in the field of education from a theoretical level. The university's secure information services platform can penetrate into all details of university management. Therefore, this paper studies the construction of a university secure information services platform based on AI, taking the dormitory allocation of freshmen and the face recognition of each building as the entry points. First, the beetle antennae search algorithm was introduced to improve the clustering efficiency and accuracy of the K-means algorithm for intelligent dormitory allocation. Then, the improved variational auto encoder-generative adversarial networks (VAE-GAN) model and convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based face recognition algorithm are proposed to enhance the security of building entry in universities. Finally, the simulation results reveal that the proposed two algorithms improve the clustering efficiency in dormitory allocation and the security of the university in the basic construction of the university information services platform, respectively.  © 2022 Zongjun Wang et al.",,Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Information management; K-means clustering; Artificial intelligence technologies; Clusterings; Complex management; Data resource managements; Entry point; Hotspots; Information service platforms; Large-scale applications; Practical tests; Search Algorithms; Efficiency,"L.

However, we claim that the current AI ethics education space relies on a form of ""exclusionary pedagogy,""where ethics is distilled for computational approaches, but there is no deeper epistemological engagement with other ways of knowing that would benefit ethical thinking or an acknowledgement of the limitations of uni-vocal computational thinking. This results in indifference, devaluation, and a lack of mutual support between CS and humanistic social science (HSS), elevating the myth of technologists as ""ethical unicorns""that can do it all, though their disciplinary tools are ultimately limited. Through an analysis of computer science education literature and a review of college-level course syllabi in AI ethics, we discuss the limitations of the epistemological assumptions and hierarchies of knowledge which dictate current attempts at including ethics education in CS training and explore evidence for the practical mechanisms through which this exclusion occurs. We then propose a shift towards a substantively collaborative, holistic, and ethically generative pedagogy in AI education. © 2021 ACM.",,Education computing; High speed steel; Philosophical aspects; Transparency; Computational approach; Computational thinkings; Computer Science Education; Disciplinary education; Ethical considerations; Ethics education; Artificial intelligence,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,978-145038309-7,,,English,"FAccT - Proc.

AI enables computers to learn from their mistakes, adapt to emerging inputs, and carry out human-like activities. Traditional Linguistic Steganographic approaches lack automation, analysis of Cover text and hidden text volume and accuracy. A formal methodology is used in only a few Steganographic approaches. In the vast majority of situations, traditional approaches fail to survive third-party vulnerability. This study looks at evaluation of an AI-based statistical language model for text Steganography. Since the advent of Natural Language Processing (NLP) into the research field, linguistic Steganography has superseded other types of Steganography. This paper proposes the positive aspects of NLP-based Markov chain model for an auto-generative cover text. The embedding rate, volume, and other attributes of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) Steganographic schemes are contrasted in this article between RNN-Stega and RNN-generated Lyrics, two RNN methods. Here the RNN model follows Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

The crucial part of building any chatbot is the development of conversation. Despite many developments in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), creating a good chatbot model remains a significant challenge in this field even today. A conversational bot can be used for countless errands. In general, they need to understand the user's intent and deliver appropriate replies. This is a software program of a conversational interface that allows a user to converse in the same manner one would address a human. Hence, these are used in almost every customer communication platform, like social networks. At present, there are two basic models used in developing a chatbot. Generative based models and Retrieval based models. The recent advancements in deep learning and artificial intelligence, such as the end-to-end trainable neural networks have rapidly replaced earlier methods based on hand-written instructions and patterns or statistical methods. This paper proposes a new method of creating a chatbot using a deep neural learning method.

With a promise to accelerate peptide development, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques including deep generative models are currently in spotlight. Scientists, however, are often overwhelmed by an excessive number of unannotated sequences generated by AI and find it difficult to obtain insights to prioritize them for experimental validation. To avoid this pitfall, we leverage molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to obtain mechanistic information to prioritize and understand AI-generated peptides. A mechanistic score of permeability is computed from five steered MD simulations starting from different initial structures predicted by homology modelling. To compensate for variability of predicted structures, the score is computed with sample variance penalization so that a peptide with consistent behaviour is highly evaluated. Our computational pipeline involving deep learning, homology modelling, MD simulations and synthesizability assessment generated 24 novel peptide sequences. The top-scoring peptide showed a consistent pattern of conformational change in all simulations regardless of initial structures. As a result of wet-lab-experiments, our peptide showed better permeability and weaker toxicity in comparison to a clinically used peptide, TAT. Our result demonstrates how MD simulations can support de novo peptide design by providing mechanistic information supplementing statistical inference. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Amino Acid Sequence; Artificial Intelligence; Cell Membrane; Cell Survival; Cell-Penetrating Peptides; HeLa Cells; Humans; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Reproducibility of Results; cell penetrating peptide; amino acid sequence; artificial intelligence; cell membrane; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; HeLa cell line; human; molecular dynamics; reproducibility,"K.

Meanwhile, other sectors (like manufacturing) adopted Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve complex, non-linear problems to reduce waste, inefficiency, and pollution. Therefore, many research efforts in the Architecture, Engineering, and Construction community have recently tried introducing AI into building asset management (AM) processes. Since AM encompasses a broad set of disciplines, an overview of several AI applications, current research gaps, and trends is needed. In this context, this study conducted the first state-of-the-art research on AI for building asset management. A total of 578 papers were analyzed with bibliometric tools to identify prominent institutions, topics, and journals. The quantitative analysis helped determine the most researched areas of AM and which AI techniques are applied. The areas were furtherly investigated by reading in-depth the 83 most relevant studies selected by screening the articles' abstracts identified in the bibliometric analysis. The results reveal many applications for Energy Management, Condition assessment, Risk management, and Project management areas. Finally, the literature review identified three main trends that can be a reference point for future studies made by practitioners or researchers: Digital Twin, Generative Adversarial Networks (with synthetic images) for data augmentation, and Deep Reinforcement Learning. © 2022 International Council for Research and Innovation in Building and Construction.

Such developments in automation and verification modes are extremely helpful in particular for government agencies who must physically assure chips with billions of transistors within critical applications. AI based techniques such as deep learning can provide a high-performance detection and recognition of elements from Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images acquired from Integrated Circuits (ICs) and understand unseen images if they are trained well. However, they require a large and diverse set of images for building their knowledge. Possessing a large number of manufactured designs as well as the high cost and execution time associated with the image acquisition process are the major bottlenecks for creating a sufficient dataset. Alternatively, conventional data augmentation techniques such as intensity change, noise injection, rotation, and translation are not always able to project the variations of images acquired by SEM with different acquisition parameters. Furthermore, augmentations like rotation, translation, and shear might generate unacceptable augmented cell structures. This paper proposes a unique approach to detect logic cells on SEM images and use the extracted samples to generate diversified synthetic logic cell images by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to address insufficient data problems. We introduce an image quality assessment metric for the synthetic dataset in order to study the qualification of generated samples for recognition computations.  © 2021 IEEE.",and SEM Microscopy; Artificial intelligence; Computer Vision; Failure Analysis and Reliability; Generative Adversarial Network; Hardware Security; Image Analytics; Jensen-Shannon Divergence,Computer circuits; Deep learning; Failure (mechanical); Failure analysis; Generative adversarial networks; Image acquisition; Integrated circuits; Large dataset; Logic circuits; Logic devices; Network security; Scanning electron microscopy; Timing circuits; And scanning electron microscopic microscopy; Critical applications; Failure analyse and reliability; Government agencies; Image analytic; Jensen-Shannon divergence; Logic cells; Microscopic image; Scanning electron microscopic; Security failure; Computer vision,"M.M.

It is therefore important to expose IT undergraduate students to it somewhere in the curriculum. However, deep learning has mathematical foundations that may be beyond the reach of the average undergraduate student. A course focusing on creative AI has been developed to introduce deep learning from the practitioner perspective. Specifically, the application of deep learning in human creative activities, such as in art, music, and multimedia, forms the basis of our educational approach. The major topics of this course are presented, along with the software tools being utilized. Sample laboratory assignments and projects are introduced, and the results of measuring various student outcomes across two semesters are presented. Overall, the use of deep learning in applications mimicking human creativity can serve the purposes of getting students excited about machine learning and also help enhance their core knowledge of programming and the utilization of standard library tools. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Artificial Neural Network; Creative Artificial Intelligence (AI); Deep Learning; Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN); Machine Learning,Curricula; Deep learning; Deep neural networks; Learning systems; Machine learning; Neural networks; Creative activity; Creative Artificial Intelligence (AI); Educational approach; Generative Adversarial Neural Network (GAN); Laboratory assignments; Mathematical foundations; Standard libraries; Undergraduate students; Students,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",,978-145036921-3,,,English,SIGITE - Proc.

In no domain has this been more true than in conversational agents (CAs). Transformer-based generative language models, such as GPT-2, significantly advance CAs' ability to generate creative and relevant content. It is critical to start exploring collaboration with these CAs. In this paper, we focus on an initial step by enabling a human-augmented, AI-driven CA to contribute to a panel discussion. Key questions include training a transformer-based AI to talk like a panelist, effectively embodying the CA to interact with panel participants, and defining the operational requirements and challenges to a CA gaining acceptance from its peers. Our results highlight the benefits that varied training, equal and dynamic representation, and fluid operation can have for AI applications. While acknowledging limitations, we present a path forward to richer, more natural human-AI collaboration. © 2021 IEEE Computer Society.

Because of its importance, lots of researches have come out. Recently, the neural generative models have shown their impressive ability as the core of chatbot, while it cannot scale well when directly applied to medical conversation due to the lack of medical-specific knowledge. To address the limitation, a scalable medical knowledge-assisted mechanism (MKA) is proposed in this paper. The mechanism is aimed at assisting general neural generative models to achieve better performance on the medical conversation task. The medical-specific knowledge graph is designed within the mechanism, which contains 6 types of medical-related information, including department, drug, check, symptom, disease, and food. Besides, the specific token concatenation policy is defined to effectively inject medical information into the input data. Evaluation of our method is carried out on two typical medical datasets, MedDG and MedDialog-CN. The evaluation results demonstrate that models combined with our mechanism outperform original methods in multiple automatic evaluation metrics. Besides, MKA-BERT-GPT achieves state-of-the-art performance.  © 2021 Ke Liang et al.",,"Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Communication; Computational Biology; Databases, Factual; Humans; Knowledge Bases; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks, Computer; Knowledge graph; Natural language processing systems; drug; Chatbots; Generative model; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-assisted; Medical information; Medical knowledge; Performance; Processing technologies; Specific knowledge; Typical application; algorithm; Article; conversation; diseases; food; friendship; human; knowledge base; medical information; medical knowledge assisted mechanism; natural language processing; self report; symptom; artificial intelligence; biology; factual database; interpersonal communication; knowledge base; Diagnosis","K.
